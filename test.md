### Hamnet -- Love in the Time of Plague. (13:00)  
[https://www.overdrive.com/media/5067417/hamnet](https://www.overdrive.com/media/5067417/hamnet)  
By [Maggie O'Farrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_O%27Farrell)  (1972 - _)  

Reader Notes:  Enter one family's world, more than 4 centuries ago.  Maggie O'Farrell delivers the magic (*her expertly-tuned imagination,  skilful editing and extremely hard work*) of helping the reader join the extended family of William Shakespeare.  The primary lens for this exploration is Agnes (*Anne*) Hathaway -- William Shakespeare is only a minor supporting role.  Marriage, motherhood, power, loss & grief, along with the *daily life* in late 16th century England are made so rich, immediate, intense, and so *real* that it is easy to lose yourself in this story.  In addition to exceptional writing, the reading by [Ell Potter](https://www.beeaudio.com/narrator/ell-potter) seemed a perfect fit.

Reader's Notes: Another excellent book!  
A [generation ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship) is launched from Earth in 2545 at 0.1 c (i.e. traveling at 108,000,000 km/h or 10% the speed of light). It includes twenty-four self-contained biomes and an average population of two thousand people.  Their destination is the Tau Ceti system to begin colonization of a planet's moon, an Earth analog, which has been named Aurora.  
The book follows Devi (the ship's de facto chief engineer and leader) and Freya (Devi's daughter) and the ship's AI quantum computer through a journey of discovery.
