# Testing File for: rrl / Recreational Reading Log: Audio Books  

(*started 2022 July 25*)  

# History:
* I started tracking by adding a reference and notes for each book that I read or listened to.  
* Over time the pages grew to an unreasonable length.  I started trying to use Github markdown collapsible sections.  Technically, they worked well, but the native github pages are not for everyone, and did not work well for non-Github users on their mobile devices...  
* Then I tried using Github pages, which was kind of a trial because of the unclear and sometimes conflicting guidance for doing so for pages that employed collapsible sections and Github markdown.  For this site, the most important *fixes* were:  
  * Always put an empty line after collapsible section tags.  
  * Put double quotes around any string that included whitespace in the site config file (_config.yml).  
  * Use the `markdown: GFM` processor in the site config file (_config.yml).  

My _config.yml file:

### Hamnet -- Love in the Time of Plague. (13:00)  
[https://www.overdrive.com/media/5067417/hamnet](https://www.overdrive.com/media/5067417/hamnet)  
By [Maggie O'Farrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_O%27Farrell)  (1972 - _)  

Reader Notes:  Enter one family's world, more than 4 centuries ago.  Maggie O'Farrell delivers the magic (*her expertly-tuned imagination,  skilful editing and extremely hard work*) of helping the reader join the extended family of William Shakespeare.  The primary lens for this exploration is Agnes (*Anne*) Hathaway -- William Shakespeare is only a minor supporting role.  Marriage, motherhood, power, loss & grief, along with the *daily life* in late 16th century England are made so rich, immediate, intense, and so *real* that it is easy to lose yourself in this story.  In addition to exceptional writing, the reading by [Ell Potter](https://www.beeaudio.com/narrator/ell-potter) seemed a perfect fit.

Reader's Notes: Another excellent book!  
A [generation ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_ship) is launched from Earth in 2545 at 0.1 c (i.e. traveling at 108,000,000 km/h or 10% the speed of light). It includes twenty-four self-contained biomes and an average population of two thousand people.  Their destination is the Tau Ceti system to begin colonization of a planet's moon, an Earth analog, which has been named Aurora.  
The book follows Devi (the ship's de facto chief engineer and leader) and Freya (Devi's daughter) and the ship's AI quantum computer through a journey of discovery.
