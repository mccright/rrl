### Page History Notes  
I did not originally format this resource for Github-pages, which left me with a lot of page layout sloth and a little legacy technology debt to deal with before these pages would display properly.  Native Github repos support a sloppy practices that do not transparently port over to Github pages.  Unfortunely, the [source repo](https://github.com/mccright/rrl) material format updating...  
The Github pages GitHub Action build logs for my page identified `jekyll-theme-primer-0.6.0` as its default theme (*Github pages [support a number of themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)*).  It displayed bright white pages, and I prefer dark background with *white* text.  The [RubyDocs for `jekyll-theme-primer`](https://rubydoc.info/gems/jekyll-theme-primer) say that users can add a new [style sheet](https://rubydoc.info/gems/jekyll-theme-primer#stylesheet) in `/assets/css/style.scss` with the following content starts the customization process:  

```css
---
---

@import "{{ site.theme }}";
```

To that add your customizations.  To get a simple `dark` theme, you can use the `body` CSS recommended by [Mark A Vitale](https://github.com/markavitale) at [https://github.com/pages-themes/primer/issues/64#issuecomment-975787330](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer/issues/64#issuecomment-975787330) for a simple `style.scss` that looks like this:  

```css 
---
---

@import "{{ site.theme }}";
body {
	background-color: black;
	filter: hue-rotate(180deg) invert(90%);
}
``` 

There is [some valid criticism](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26472246) of this approach, but it works for this github-pages site.
