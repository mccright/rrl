### Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6711  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Dru:_Administrator  
By [Edward Mandell House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._House) (1858–1938), published 1912  
Utopian reformer..."we are entering a new era. The past is no longer to be a guide to the future…"  
Main characters: Phillip Dru, Gloria Strawn, Senator Selwyn  
Also: Governor James R. Rockland (earmarks of a demagogue)…  
The story outlines how society is corrupted by Dark money, Control of the press, Corrupt high-finance personalitie, Anti-democracy Senators, and a Corrupt anti-democracy President (Rockland)  
    …who was ignorant of history  
    …who picks three compliant Supreme Court justices  
There are recordings that capture corrupt acts by the President, and a Whistleblower.  
Corrupt leaders are defiant & claim others were doing what they were charged with, and that they were trying to protect America…  They:  
    …Moved troops to cities and the navy to U.S. coasts  
    …dehumanized political opponents  
    …chose quick violence against protest  
Civil War follows — unrealistic assertions about the nature and practice of war.  More than 50,000 die in the one and only battle -- and the war is won…  
General Dru remakes the U.S. as a more fair society with a smaller and more responsive government (*too often just by saying so*...)  
At the highest level, much of writing is sophomoric and the characters almost comically wooden. (From: "What Colonel House Thinks." by William Marion Reedy, Reedy's Mirror, April 6th, 1917 [pages 239-240](https://archive.org/details/sim_reedys-mirror_1917-04-06_26_14/page/n4/mode/1up))  
One more thing.  Edward M. House wrote this story about the 1920s sometime before publishing it in 1912, and he included an electric automobile as a *normal* mode of transportation (*when Gloria Strawn picks up Phillip Dru at the train station*).  

### Roger the Ranger: A Story of Border Life Among the Indians  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68694  
By [Eliza Fanny Pollard](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Eliza_Fanny_Pollard) (1840–1911), published 1893  
Summary: Historical fiction likely targeted at middle-schoolers...  [Charles Langlade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel_de_Langlade) and (*fictional*) Roger Boscowen, friends since childhood, part ways when they choose opposite sides in the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War) (*1750s*).  Famous French General [Louis de Montcalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Joseph_de_Montcalm) joined Canada and is helped by Langlade -- but less by Canadian Governor [Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Rigaud,_marquis_de_Vaudreuil-Cavagnial).  Some in the government of French Canada use De Montcalm's daughter to increase the complexity of the General's job...  This is not a history of the French and Indian War and veers far from some of the facts as they are known today.  Rather, it is a morality tale, a family drama, and a coming-of-age story that occurs mid-18th century New England.

Audio of 1858 version: https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/
By [William Falconer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Falconer_(poet)) (1732-1769)  
"William Falconer's "The Shipwreck" recounts the final voyage of the merchant ship Britannia and her crew.  See the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) summary at: https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/library-archive/shipwreck-william-falconer  
[RMG Digital Resources Librarian 'Renee' says](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/william-falconers-shipwreck): "Part fiction, part autobiography and part instructional guide for sailors, William Falconer's poem The Shipwreck is a must-read for Patrick O'Brian fans. Fair enough, there's no Jack Aubrey character - but the combination of high seas drama and technical detail makes for a surprisingly compelling read."  
Librivox Summary: A semi-autobiographical poem in three cantos recounts the wreck of the merchant ship Britannia. Written by William Falconer, a seaman of some experience, who survived one shipwreck himself with only two others of the 50 man crew and eventually perished in the loss of a second ship, the frigate Aurora, 20 years later. The poem is recognized for its realistic portrayal of life aboard an 18th century sailing vessel. [Summary by Fritz](https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/)

### An Outlaw's Diary: Revolution  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69121  
By [Cécile Tormay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9cile_Tormay)  (1876-1937)  Published 1923
Summary from Wikipedia:  
> Originally "Bujdosó könyv" (1923) -- which is translated literally as "The Proscribed Book," but an English translation was published as "An Outlaw's Diary" (1923). It provides a hostile account of the 1918–1919 (Hungarian) revolution and the subsequent Hungarian Soviet Republic led by Béla Kun. She also bemoaned the division of the Kingdom of Hungary which led to territorial concessions to the Kingdom of Roumania, This book is cited as evidence of Tomay's anti-semitism as she claims that "The demon of the revolution is not an individual, not a party, but a race among the races. The Jews are the last people of the Ancient East who survived among the newer peoples of shorter history."

Summary from the book's Foreward:

[alibris Summary](https://www.alibris.com/Calendars-and-Constellations-of-the-Ancient-World-Emmeline-Plunket/book/886454):  
>The great temple of Amen-Ra at Thebes... is oriented to the setting sun of the season so important to Egyptians, that of the summer solstice, and this fact strengthens the opinion that Amen was considered to be a god in some way presiding over the course of the year and its right measurement. -from "Amen and the Egyptian Year" First published in 1903 as Ancient Calendars and Constellations, this overview of early astronomical observations and how they influenced the belief systems and religions of early civilizations quickly became a resource later scholars looked to for guidance. From the very beginnings of astronomy, nearly 8,000 years ago, to the more "modern" ancient astronomies of Greece, Egypt, India, Persia, and China, this charming and erudite book will fascinate students of science, history, and mythology as well as lovers of the night sky.
