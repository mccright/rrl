<details><summary>Anchorite. By Randall Garrett.  1962 </summary>

### Anchorite.  1962  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23561  
Audio at: https://librivox.org/anchorite-by-randall-garrett/  
By [Randall Garrett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Garrett)  (1927-1987)  
Reading Notes:  This story (*and the Librivox summary below*) while entertaining and a worthwhile read, seem loosely like a science fiction expression of [Ayn Rand'ian romantic realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand#Literary_approach_and_influences) -- with the central characters as heroic individualists or ignorant villains who emphasize duty to your team and collectivist moral ideals.  
[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/anchorite-by-randall-garrett/):  
>Randall Garrett sticks a sharp needle into our government and society in this wonderful story. He projects the current trends towards paternalistic government into the future. Yes, we have attained a world government and everyone is equal whether they want to be or not; everyone is taken care of no matter how incompetent, stupid or sleazy they are and everyone is out to undermine everyone else. The author predicts (sadly only too well) what the trends of today will eventually produce if allowed to continue. But wait! there is hope in the asteroid belt where jerks and incompetents are weeded out by hard physical laws and only those who possess common sense and the ability to actually survive are allowed to govern. But will the Earth government allow this to continue? Of course not. Listen to this great story to have a peek into the future.

<summary>"The Dred Scott Decision: Majority Opinion By Chief Justice Taney." By Roger Brooke Taney. 1857 </summary>

### The Dred Scott Decision: Majority Opinion By Chief Justice Taney.  
This ebook: https://www.loc.gov/item/17001543/  
[The full The Dred Scott v. Sandford Decision](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf) *which adds another ~180 pages of opinions by other members of the Supreme Court*  
[The Dred Scott v. Sandford Decision Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford).  
By [Roger Brooke Taney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Taney) (1777 - 1864)  
Introduction by Dr. [John H. Van Evrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Van_Evrie), "*defender of slavery*." (1814 - 1896)  
and  
Appendix. "Natural History Of The Prognathous Species Of Mankind." By Dr. [Samuel A. Cartwright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_A._Cartwright), *inventor of the 'mental illness' of [drapetomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania), the desire of a slave for freedom*. (1793 - 1863)  

Reader notes:  I read this in early 2024 while thinking about the increasing volume of *race-related* arguments in Far Right and Trumpist/Trumper rhetoric that I see in *print* news and in streaming *news-like* programming.  It is a depressing read -- made more depressing when paired with its "*echos*" in political speech in the U.S. today.  That said, I recommend this exercise to anyone who has only a foggy memory (*or less*) of the kind of language and logic used in mid-19th century America to justify and solidify Black slavery in the U.S. [*Update* late February 2024: Listening to some of the legislative debate about a bill to specify content of public school social studies classes in Iowa, I heard one Iowa legislator argue that the topic of slavery in the U.S. is not important enough to include in the Iowa public school social studies curriculum. Ugg... Some people need much more help than will be found in this 1857 publication.]  
As a reminder to those who forgot their High School history or government class summary of this case, "[Taney infamously delivered the majority opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), ruling that African Americans could not be considered U.S. citizens (*and thus they could not enjoy the rights and privileges the Constitution conferred upon American citizens*) and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the U.S. territories.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Taney)."  Chief Justice Taney wrote for the majority that African Americans:  
>"are not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word “citizens” in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for and secures to citizens of the United States. On the contrary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated 18 or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the government might choose to grant them." ([page 30](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llst/022/022.pdf?#page=30))  

and that:  
>"a perpetual and impassable barrier was intended to be erected between the white race and the one which they had reduced to slavery, and governed as subjects with absolute and despotic power... ([page 36](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llst/022/022.pdf?#page=36))  

and finally, that:  
>"it is the opinion of the court that the act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property of this kind in the territory of the United States north of the line therein mentioned, is not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore void. ([page 87](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llst/022/022.pdf?#page=87))  
The "Introduction" and "Appendix" [of this 1860 printing](https://www.loc.gov/item/17001543/) wrap *some* late-1850s social context to the Supreme Court opinion.  Unfortunately, some of the "*race science*" and "state's rights" themes in those two essays seem to be appearing again in Far Right and Trumpist/Trumper *[dog whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics))* talking points.

<details><summary>The Expendables. by A. E. Van Vogt  1963</summary>  

### The Expendables.  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70235  
By [Van Vogt, A. E. (Alfred Elton)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._van_Vogt), (1912-2000)  
...especially [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._van_Vogt#Critical_reception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._van_Vogt#Critical_reception)  

Reading Notes:  This short book begins with "One hundred and nine years after leaving Earth, the spaceship, Hope of Man, went into orbit around Alta III."  Sending a spaceship to a planet over 100 light-years away involves a lot of guess-work about the nature of their destination.  In this story, some of the original guesses were wrong.

### The Farmer's Bride.  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71305  
Audio: https://librivox.org/the-farmers-bride-by-charlotte-mew/  
By [Charlotte Mew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Mew) (1869 - 1928)  

Wikipedia Summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer's_Bride  
Librivox Summary:  
>The Farmer's Bride is a collection of 28 poems by British modernist writer Charlotte Mew. The original edition was published in 1916; this edition, published in 1921, contains 11 more poems. Mew's poetry is varied in style and content, but manifests a concern with gender issues throughout. Mew's life was marked by loneliness and depression, and she eventually committed suicide. Her work earned her the admiration of her peers, including Virginia Woolf, who characterized her as "very good and quite unlike anyone else."

https://archive.org/details/Weird_Tales_v37n05_1944-05_LPM-AT/page/n77/mode/2up  
By [Ray Bradbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury) (1920 - 2012)  

Reading Notes:  The opportunity to read this short story is worth any hassle of finding the text on archive.org.  
Summary from Wikipedia:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lake_(short_story)  
Background from Wikipedia:  
>Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at a lake edge and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later (*at 22 years old*), as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.  When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, he replied: "From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who've said things well." He said: "If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury#Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury#Writing)

<details><summary>The Lord of the Sea.  By M. P. Shiel.  1901 (revised 1924)</summary>

### The Lord of the Sea  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6993  
By [M. P. Shiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._P._Shiel) (*Matthew Phipps Shiel,* 1865-1947)  
Reading Notes and 3rd Party Summaries:  
Reading Notes: This book is characterized by "choppy" story telling -- skipping from one vignette to another, sometimes with minimal connective tissue, and fleshing out some (*few*) scenes while leaving others dryly skeletal. Shiel seems most consistent in his threading of anti-semitism throughout the many literary sketches that make up this book (*this content may be offensive for many, even inappropriate for some*).

<details><summary>My Three Years In Manipur: And Escape From The Recent Mutiny. By Ethel St. Clair Grimwood. 1891 </summary>

### My Three Years In Manipur: And Escape From The Recent Mutiny.  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/71726  
https://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/grimwood/manipur/manipur.html  
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.44982/mode/2up  
By [Ethel St. Clair Grimwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Grimwood)  (1867 – 1928)  

Reader's Notes:  This first-person description of (1) late 19th century Manipur (*an Indian state on the Eastern edge of the country*), (2) British colonialism in India within a very specific set of circumstances and (3) what it was like as a British official's wife to be under attack and fleeing in late 19th century Manipur/South Asia.  
This book includes some sterotyping based on race, ethnicity and other characteristics that may shape society.  Some might be repulsed by how oppression built around the concepts of gender, race, caste, and class are expressed throughout this story. It might be easy for a 21st century reader to pass these off as parodies of British colonial society at that time, but they seem to be expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of her readers at the time.  As much as we can know, her written words are facts of 19th century British colonial *management* -- as well as expressions of immoral, unethical and unprincipled, disgraceful, sometimes shocking and corrupt, even evil behaviors.  This book may be hurtful to some.  

[Publisher Description](https://books.apple.com/us/book/my-three-years-in-manipur-and-escape-from-the/id934055203):  
>The Fantastic story of the “Heroine of Manipur” who led to bloody, battered survivors of the Manipur Mutiny to safety over some of the roughest roads in all of India. Includes 9 illustrations.  “Manipur, Rebellion in (1891). This small state in north-eastern India southeast of Assam was a quasi-independent British protectorate ruled from 1834 by Chandra Kirti Singh (1832-1866). On his death his sons and other relatives formed numerous parties, each contending for the throne. In the midst of general unrest, on 24 March 1891 the British political agent and other resident British officials were murdered, and the residency in Manipur was attacked. The small surviving band of loyal sepoys was led to safety in India by Ethel St Clair Grimwood, the wife of the slain Political Resident. The British sent troops into the country and, after several encounters with the 3000-man Manipuri army, finally restored order. The offending princes were hanged or transported to the Andaman Islands. Mrs Grimwood was awarded the Royal Red Cross.”-Farwell

<summary>Observations on the Slave Trade and a Description of some part of the Coast of Guinea... By Carl Bernhard Wadström. 1789 </summary>

### Observations on the Slave Trade and a Description of some part of the Coast of Guinea, during a voyage, made in 1787, and 1788, in company with Doctor A. Sparrman and Captain Arrehenius.  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69156  
By [Carl Bernhard Wadström](https://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/wadstrom.htm)  (1746-1799)  

Reading Notes: By 1779 Swede Carl Bernhard Wadström was a convert to [Emanuel Swedenborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg)’s doctrines, and in that year he and [Augustus Nordenskjöld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Nordenski%C3%B6ld) formed a Swedenborgian anti-slavery group in [Norrköping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrk%C3%B6ping), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden). The Norrköping Swedenborgian group birthed a *plan* for a colony in Africa built on agricultural trade as an alternative to slavery -- its long term purpose being the abolition of slavery -- or at least of providing a free alternative to it. King Gustav III granted a charter for forty families to emigrate.  That effort was delayed by war between England and France [from [Robert William Rix](https://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/wadstrom.htm)].  After years of delay, in 1787 [Wadström](https://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/wadstrom.htm) (*[also now a central figure in the British abolition movement](https://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/wadstrom.htm)*) accompanied by [Carl Axel Arrhenius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Axel_Arrhenius) and [Anders Sparrman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Sparrman) traveled to West Africa for scientific investigations in Senegal.  This book, "Observations on the Slave Trade..." is one of the outputs of that journey and describes some of what Wadström observed and some of what he thought about it -- *in the context of his experiences and beliefs leading up to the late 1780s*.  

As a reminder, the slave trade had already been active and evolving for **170 years** in what is now United States of America by the time Mr. Wadström journied to West Aftica and wrote this book (*see: [The 1619 Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1619_Project) and "[The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_1619_Project:_A_New_Origin_Story)"*).

Paley, "[“A New Heaven Is Begun”: William Blake And Swedenborgianism](https://bq.blakearchive.org/13.2.paley)," and another by Klas Rönnbäck, "[Enlightenment, Scientific Exploration and Abolitionism: Anders Sparrman's and Carl Bernhard Wadström's Colonial Encounters in Senegal, 1787–1788 and the British Abolitionist Movement](https://doi.org/10.1080/0144039X.2012.734113)." in A Journal of Slave and Post-Slave Studies.

<details><summary>The Quantum Jump.  By Robert Wicks.  1958</summary>

### The Quantum Jump.

This story was published in Amazing Science Fiction Stories, October 1958.  
By [Robert Wicks]()  ( – ) [*I couldn't find any bio information for Robert Wicks*]

<details><summary>Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935.  By Edward Mandell House.  1912 </summary>

### Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6711  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Dru:_Administrator  
By [Edward Mandell House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._House) (1858–1938), published 1912  
Utopian reformer..."we are entering a new era. The past is no longer to be a guide to the future…"  
Main characters: Phillip Dru, Gloria Strawn, Senator Selwyn  
Also: Governor James R. Rockland (earmarks of a demagogue)…  
The story outlines how society is corrupted by Dark money, Control of the press, Corrupt high-finance personalities, Anti-democracy Senators, and a Corrupt anti-democracy President (Rockland)  
    …who was ignorant of history  
    …who picks three compliant Supreme Court justices  
There are recordings that capture corrupt acts by the President, and a Whistleblower.  
Corrupt leaders are defiant & claim others were doing what they were charged with, and that they were trying to protect America…  They:  
    …Moved troops to cities and the navy to U.S. coasts  
    …dehumanized political opponents  
    …chose quick violence against protest  
Civil War follows — unrealistic assertions about the nature and practice of war.  More than 50,000 die in the one and only battle -- and the war is won…  
General Dru remakes the U.S. as a more fair society with a smaller and more responsive government (*too often just by saying so*...)  
At the highest level, much of writing is sophomoric and the characters almost comically wooden. (From: "What Colonel House Thinks." by William Marion Reedy, Reedy's Mirror, April 6th, 1917 [pages 239-240](https://archive.org/details/sim_reedys-mirror_1917-04-06_26_14/page/n4/mode/1up))  
One more thing.  Edward M. House wrote this story about the 1920s sometime before publishing it in 1912, and he included an electric automobile as a *normal* mode of transportation (*when Gloria Strawn picks up Phillip Dru at the train station*).

<details><summary>Roger the Ranger: A Story of Border Life Among the Indians. By Eliza Fanny Pollard.  1893 </summary>

### Roger the Ranger: A Story of Border Life Among the Indians  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68694  
By [Eliza Fanny Pollard](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Eliza_Fanny_Pollard) (1840–1911), published 1893  

Reader Summary: Historical fiction likely targeted at middle-schoolers...  [Charles Langlade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel_de_Langlade) and (*fictional*) Roger Boscowen, friends since childhood, part ways when they choose opposite sides in the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War) (*1750s*).  Famous French General [Louis de Montcalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Joseph_de_Montcalm) joined Canada and is helped by Langlade -- but less by Canadian Governor [Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Rigaud,_marquis_de_Vaudreuil-Cavagnial).  Some in the government of French Canada use De Montcalm's daughter to increase the complexity of the General's job...  This is not a history of the French and Indian War and veers far from some of the facts as they are known today.  Rather, it is a morality tale, a family drama, and a coming-of-age story that occurs mid-18th century New England.

By [William Falconer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Falconer_(poet)) (1732-1769)  

Reading Notes:  
The interesting biography of William Falconer was more enjoyable than the extensive poem.  The style and some content of the poetry may turn some off, but it includes some excellent rhymes (*think song lyrics*).  
3rd Party Summaries:  
"William Falconer's "The Shipwreck" recounts the final voyage of the merchant ship Britannia and her crew.  See the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) summary at: https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/library-archive/shipwreck-william-falconer  
[RMG Digital Resources Librarian 'Renee' says](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/william-falconers-shipwreck): "Part fiction, part autobiography and part instructional guide for sailors, William Falconer's poem The Shipwreck is a must-read for Patrick O'Brian fans. Fair enough, there's no Jack Aubrey character - but the combination of high seas drama and technical detail makes for a surprisingly compelling read."  
Librivox Summary: A semi-autobiographical poem in three cantos recounts the wreck of the merchant ship Britannia. Written by William Falconer, a seaman of some experience, who survived one shipwreck himself with only two others of the 50 man crew and eventually perished in the loss of a second ship, the frigate Aurora, 20 years later. The poem is recognized for its realistic portrayal of life aboard an 18th century sailing vessel. [Summary by Fritz](https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/)

In the present paper these considerations will be further developed, and it will be shown that it seems possible on the theory to account for some of the characteristic features of the recent discovery by Stark[3] of the effect of an electric field on spectral lines, as well as of the effect of a magnetic field first discovered by Zeeman. It will also be shown that the theory seems to offer an explanation of the appearance of ordinary double spectral lines[4]."

Summary/Review by [Gideon Marcus](https://gideonmarcus.com/about-me/) from galacticjourney.org: [The Impersonator](http://galacticjourney.org/stories/6011IF9.pdf), the third story ever published by Robert Wicks.  In the midling future, the Earth is threatened by an impending Ice Age thanks to humanity’s rapacious exploitation of the planet’s resources.  A host of outrageous plans are developed to fix the problem: from salting ice fields with carbon dust, to altering the axial tilt of the planet, to tapping the heat from the Earth’s core.  It’s not a great story, but I liked Wicks’ satirical presentation of “doubling down” in an attempt to thwart catastrophe.  Three stars.

Summary by Eric Nyquist:  
>Wade Nyquist, was captured by the German army in Tunisia in 1943, and remained a POW until 1945. He was eventually persuaded by my Grandmother to recount the whole story so she could write it down.  At some point, my Grandmother typed up several copies of the original papers and passed them out to her kids. I found one of these copies at my Aunt's house, and scanned each page to have a digital copy for myself.  It's a fascinating piece of history, which [you can download here](https://www.ekn.io/wadenyquist/).

Librivox Summary:  
>Jonathan Swift almost defines satire in this biting and brutal pamphlet in which he suggests that poor (Catholic) Irish families should fatten up their children and sell them to the rich (Protestant) land owners, thus solving the twin problems of starving children and poverty in one blow. When the “Proposal” was published in 1729, Swift was quickly attacked, and even accused of barbarity – the exact state the “Proposal” was written to expose.

By [Cécile Tormay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9cile_Tormay)  (1876-1937)  Published 1923
Summary from Wikipedia:  
> Originally "Bujdosó könyv" (1923) -- which is translated literally as "The Proscribed Book," but an English translation was published as "An Outlaw's Diary" (1923). It provides a hostile account of the 1918–1919 (Hungarian) revolution and the subsequent Hungarian Soviet Republic led by Béla Kun. She also bemoaned the division of the Kingdom of Hungary which led to territorial concessions to the Kingdom of Roumania, This book is cited as evidence of Tomay's anti-semitism as she claims that "The demon of the revolution is not an individual, not a party, but a race among the races. The Jews are the last people of the Ancient East who survived among the newer peoples of shorter history."

### Ancient calendars and constellations  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/70052  
By [Emmeline M. Plunket]()  
[alibris Summary](https://www.alibris.com/Calendars-and-Constellations-of-the-Ancient-World-Emmeline-Plunket/book/886454):  
>The great temple of Amen-Ra at Thebes... is oriented to the setting sun of the season so important to Egyptians, that of the summer solstice, and this fact strengthens the opinion that Amen was considered to be a god in some way presiding over the course of the year and its right measurement. -from "Amen and the Egyptian Year" First published in 1903 as Ancient Calendars and Constellations, this overview of early astronomical observations and how they influenced the belief systems and religions of early civilizations quickly became a resource later scholars looked to for guidance. From the very beginnings of astronomy, nearly 8,000 years ago, to the more "modern" ancient astronomies of Greece, Egypt, India, Persia, and China, this charming and erudite book will fascinate students of science, history, and mythology as well as lovers of the night sky.
