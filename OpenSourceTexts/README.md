### Roger the Ranger: A Story of Border Life Among the Indians  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68694  
By Eliza Fanny Pollard (1840–1911), published 1893  
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Eliza_Fanny_Pollard  
Summary: Historical fiction targeted at what we now call middle-schoolers...  [Charles Langlade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel_de_Langlade) and (*fictional*) Roger Boscowen, friends since childhood, part ways when they choose opposite sides in the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War) (*1750s*).  Famous French General [Louis de Montcalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Joseph_de_Montcalm) joined Canada and is helped by Langlade -- but less by Canadian Governor [Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Rigaud,_marquis_de_Vaudreuil-Cavagnial).  Some in the government of French Canada use De Montcalm's daughter to increase the complexity of the General's job...  This is not a history of the French and Indian War and veers far from some of the facts as they are known today.  Rather, it is a morality tale, a family drama, and a coming-of-age story that occurs mid-18th century New England.
