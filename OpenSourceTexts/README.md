### Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6711  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Dru:_Administrator  
By [Edward Mandell House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._House) (1858–1938), published 1912  
Utopian reformer..."we are entering a new era. The past is no longer to be a guide to the future…"  
Main characters: Phillip Dru, Gloria Strawn, Senator Selwyn  
Also: Governor James R. Rockland (earmarks of a demagogue)…  
The story outlines how society is corrupted by Dark money, Control of the press, Corrupt high-finance personalitie, Anti-democracy Senators, and a Corrupt anti-democracy President (Rockland)  
    …who was ignorant of history  
    …who picks three compliant Supreme Court justices  
There are recordings that capture corrupt acts by the President, and a Whistleblower.  
Corrupt leaders are defiant & claim others were doing what they were charged with, and that they were trying to protect America…  They:  
    …Moved troops to cities and the navy to U.S. coasts  
    …dehumanized political opponents  
    …chose quick violence against protest  
Civil War follows — unrealistic assertions about the nature and practice of war.  More than 50,000 die in the one and only battle -- and the war is won…  
General Dru remakes the U.S. as a more fair society with a smaller and more responsive government (*too often just by saying so*...)  
At the highest level, much of writing is sophomoric and the characters almost comically wooden. (From: "What Colonel House Thinks." by William Marion Reedy, Reedy's Mirror, April 6th, 1917 [pages 239-240](https://archive.org/details/sim_reedys-mirror_1917-04-06_26_14/page/n4/mode/1up))  
One more thing.  Edward M. House wrote this story about the 1920s sometime before publishing it in 1912, and he included an electric automobile as a *normal* mode of transportation (*when Gloria Strawn picks up Phillip Dru at the train station*).  

### Roger the Ranger: A Story of Border Life Among the Indians  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68694  
By [Eliza Fanny Pollard](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Eliza_Fanny_Pollard) (1840–1911), published 1893  
Summary: Historical fiction targeted at what we now call middle-schoolers...  [Charles Langlade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel_de_Langlade) and (*fictional*) Roger Boscowen, friends since childhood, part ways when they choose opposite sides in the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War) (*1750s*).  Famous French General [Louis de Montcalm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis-Joseph_de_Montcalm) joined Canada and is helped by Langlade -- but less by Canadian Governor [Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Rigaud,_marquis_de_Vaudreuil-Cavagnial).  Some in the government of French Canada use De Montcalm's daughter to increase the complexity of the General's job...  This is not a history of the French and Indian War and veers far from some of the facts as they are known today.  Rather, it is a morality tale, a family drama, and a coming-of-age story that occurs mid-18th century New England.
