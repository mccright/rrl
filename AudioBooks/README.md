### The Ambassadors (16:46)  
https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors  
https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/432  
By **Henry James** (1843 - 1916), published 1903  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James  
Summary from Librivox:  
Henry James considered The Ambassadors his best, or perhaps his best-wrought, novel. It plays on the great Jamesian theme of the American abroad, who finds himself in an older, and some would say richer, culture that that of the United States, with its attractions and dangers. Here the protagonist is Lambert Strether, a man in his fifties, editor of a small literary magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, who arrives in Europe on a mission undertaken at the urging of his patron, Mrs. Newsome, to bring back her son Chadwick. That young man appears to be enjoying his time in Paris rather more than seems good for him, at least to those older and wiser. The novel, however, is perhaps really about Strether's education in this new land, and one of his teachers is the city of Paris -- a real Paris, not an idealized one, but from which Strether has much to learn. Chad Newsome, of course is there too, and so are a scattering of other Americans, his old friend Waymarsh and his new acquaintance Maria Gostrey among them. Had Strether his life to live over again, knowing what he has now learned, how different would it be? and what are the lessons he takes home with him?  


### Atlantis  (13:59)  
https://librivox.org/atlantis-by-gerhart-hauptmann/  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17241  
By **Gerhart Hauptmann** (1862 - 1946)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann  
Translated by **Adele Szold Seltzer** (1876 - 1940)  
Summary from Librivox:  
Frederick von Kammacher is a young doctor in Germany whose wife has gone insane, whose children are in a boarding school, and whose career has been destroyed by some faulty research he has done. He becomes infatuated with a teenage dancer, and on a whim he boards the the same steamship the dancer is on bound for New York. Hauptmann was heralded as a seer for his description of what happens to their steamship mid-ocean, and what in reality happened to the Titanic only months later.  


### Blake of the "Rattlesnake"  (5:21)  
https://librivox.org/blake-of-the-rattlesnake-by-frederick-thomas-jane/  
https://archive.org/details/blakerattlesnak00janegoog  
By **Frederick Thomas Jane** (1865 - 1916)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_T._Jane  
Summary from Librivox:  
Fred Jane, who later went on to publish his famous "Jane's Fighting Ships", doubtless was noting the success of other books that forecast a British defeat in the event of war in the late 19th century when he wrote this fictional account of "The Man Who Saved England." Jane tells of a possible war against both France and Russia with plenty of verve and derring-do amid naval battles, both small and large.  


### Captains Courageous  (5:57)  
https://librivox.org/captains-courageous-by-rudyard-kipling/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captains_Courageous  
https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2186  
By **Rudyard Kipling** (1868 - 1936), published 1897  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling  
Summary from Librivox:  
Real men don't take guff from snotty kids. Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the "We're Here", a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.  
And when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life.  


### Kings, Queens and Pawns: An American Woman at the Front  (10:27)  
https://librivox.org/kings-queens-and-pawns-by-mary-roberts-rinehart/  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14457  
By **Mary Roberts Rinehart** (1876 - 1958)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Roberts_Rinehart  
Summary from Librivox:  
A personal account of the American author's visit to Europe in January 1915 while a war correspondent in Belgium for The Saturday Evening Post. She writes: "War is not two great armies meeting in a clash and frenzy of battle. It is much more than that. War is a boy carried on a stretcher, looking up at God's blue sky with bewildered eyes that are soon to close; war is a woman carrying a child that has been wounded by a shell; war is spirited horses tied in burning buildings and waiting for death; war is the flower of a race, torn, battered, hungry, bleeding, up to its knees in icy water; war is an old woman burning a candle before the Mater Dolorosa for the son she has given.
