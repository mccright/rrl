<summary>The Ambassadors. By Henry James, 1903</summary>

### The Ambassadors (16:46)  
https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors  
Text at: https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/432  
By [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James) (1843 - 1916), published 1903  
Reading Notes: I recommend this excellent 19th century novel to anyone who has the time to think about their place and role in the world...  
Summary from Librivox:  
Henry James considered The Ambassadors his best, or perhaps his best-wrought, novel. It plays on the great Jamesian theme of the American abroad, who finds himself in an older, and some would say richer, culture that that of the United States, with its attractions and dangers.  
Here the protagonist is Lambert Strether, a man in his fifties, editor of a small literary magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, who arrives in Europe on a mission undertaken at the urging of his patron, Mrs. Newsome, to bring back her son Chadwick. 
That young man appears to be enjoying his time in Paris rather more than seems good for him, at least to those older and wiser. 
The novel, however, is perhaps really about Strether's education in this new land, and one of his teachers is the city of Paris -- a real Paris, not an idealized one, but from which Strether has much to learn.  
Chad Newsome, of course is there too, and so are a scattering of other Americans, his old friend Waymarsh and his new acquaintance Maria Gostrey among them.  
Had Strether his life to live over again, knowing what he has now learned, how different would it be? and what are the lessons he takes home with him?

<summary>The Demi-Gods, By James Stephens. 1914</summary>

### The Demi-Gods (4:37)  
https://librivox.org/the-demi-gods-by-james-stephens/  
Text: https://archive.org/details/thedemigods00steprich/page/n7/mode/2up  
By [James Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stephens_(author)) (1882 - 1950). Published 1914.   Reader's Notes:  This book is a lot of fun and the excellent reading/acting by Joe Bergin is a huge plus. Thank you Mr. Bergin!  
Librivox Summary:  
>In this memorialized Irish tale, 3 huge winged demi-gods (part god/part human) have descended to earth to experience human existence. They encounter Patsy Mac Can and his daughter Mary at their campfire one evening, two vagabonds who wander about Ireland with donkey and cart, eating off the land, meeting a variety of dubious characters along the way, who in the great Irish tradition of storytelling, all have stories to tell. The Mac Cans welcome the strangers, feed them, show them around, along the way spinning yarns and explaining their gypsy "philosophies". Those familiar with Stephens's quirky writing style appreciate him as a quick witted, keen observer, seeing both the ridiculous and the sublime in everyday things, exploring the points of view of various animals and insects as well as the human characters. Eventually the troupe parts company, having forged close bonds of friendship. This is an entertaining adult love story that would not offend a child, read charmingly by authentic Irishman Joe Bergin.

<summary>The Chouans. By Honoré de Balzac.  1829</summary>

### The Chouans (15:55)  
https://librivox.org/the-chouans-version-2-by-honore-de-balzac/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Chouans  
Text: https://archive.org/details/chouansleschouan00balz/page/n7/mode/2up  
By [Honoré de Balzac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac) (1799 - 1850)  
Translated by [Ellen Marriage]() (1865 - 1946)  
Reading Notes: This story is one way to enhance any study of revolution and civil war in France, and more generally of French history.  Reading by Bruce Pirie makes this an enjoyable audio experience as well.  I assume that for some, there are issues of 18th/19th century female stereotypes and related derogatory terms.  
Summary on Librivox:  
>“The Chouans” (1829) was the first novel published under Balzac’s own name (rather than a pen-name). It became the first book in the great work of his lifetime — the novel series titled “The Human Comedy.”  Balzac was impressed by the writings of Sir Walter Scott. Scott made Scottish history come alive by creating fictions that used real history as backdrop. Balzac’s novel is set in 1799 — the year that Napoleon became First Consul of France. In the far west of France (i.e., Brittany), anti-revolutionary sentiment still simmered. The Chouans were a rustic guerrilla militia who wanted to undo the French Revolution and restore the old Bourbon monarchy. Pitted against them were the forces of the new Republic and its military (“the Blues”). Balzac researched this historical period as well as living conditions for Bretons of that time, then wove into the actual history his own fictional account of a romance between lovers from opposite factions in the dispute.  In “The Chouans,” we see an early and influential example of “historical fiction,” a genre which blossomed in popularity during the 1800s, and remains popular in today’s novels and films.

<summary>Saint Joan: Preface.  By George Bernard Shaw.  1923</summary>

### Saint Joan: Preface  (2:12)  
https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joan_(play)  
Text: https://archive.org/details/SaintJoan/page/n1  
By [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw) (1856 - 1950)  
Reading Notes:  If you have even a microscopic interest in 'Saint Joan' or Middle Ages France, this seems like an excellent little book (*maybe just an essay*).  It assumes that the reader understands some about mid-20th century Brittan and New York, but is still a pleasure in relative ignorance of both.  The reading by David Wales is a perfect match.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Saint Joan is a play by George Bernard Shaw about 15th-century French military figure Joan of Arc. Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play reflects Shaw's belief that the people involved in Joan's trial acted according to what they thought was right. He wrote in his preface to the play: “There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.” (Wikipedia) Modern British author, critic, poet, and broadcaster Clive James, commenting on a book that changed his mind, wrote: “George Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.” (The Guardian, 5 October 2019) [Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales](https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/)

<summary>Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series. By E. E. Smith, 1948</summary>  

### Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series (10:31)  
https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706  
By [E. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith) (1890 - 1965)  published 1948  
Reading Notes: Published in 1948 and 1950, the Triplanetary and First Lensman books express a fantastic post-WWII U.S.A. optimism about technology, all things "the Atom," and the supremacy of North American military power. 
The characters that drive the story forward are white male North Americans. 
The lensmen engage in massive death & destruction in their quest for "increasing the general happiness of all humanity" (*a seeming contradiction they don't acknowlege*). 
The most evil characters are leaders and their followers in North American Nationalist politics -- in league with organized crime.  When these politicians & other criminals are caught, they use features of the existing legal system as weapons and delay, delay, delay (*sound like a 'real life' former Present and his lackies?*). A core theme seems to be a battle between the "uncorruptable" (*democrats*) and the "corrupt" (*athoritarians*) -- with "civilization" owing everything to the "uncorruptable." 
There are minor characters from other many planets and galacies.  
Summary:  
>Triplanetary was first serialized in Amazing Stories in 1934. After the [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series) became popular, Smith took his Triplanetary story and turned it into the first of the Lensman series, using it as a prequel to give the back story for the protaganists in the Lensmen series. He added 6 new chapters, doubling it in size and it's really a different book from the serialized novel, being published 14 years after the first. It was put into Gutenberg just last year. 
>The novel covers several episodes in an eons-long eugenics project of the super-intelligences of the Arisia. This alien race is breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their arch enemy, the Eddore. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's (Gharlane of Eddore) reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two and Three. The final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster than light travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, two very important members of the eugenics project, are introduced. They will play the leading roles in the next story, First Lensman. (Summary by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)) and [Phil Chenevert](https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/))

Reading Notes: (*see 'Triplanetary' above*)  
>The Secret Planet. No human had ever landed on the hidden planet of Arisia. A mysterious space barrier turned back both men and ships. Then the word came to Earth, "Go to Arisia!", Virgil Samms of the Galactic Patrol went--and came back with the Lens, the strange device that gave its wearer powers no man had ever possessed before. Samms knew the price of that power would be high. But even he had no idea of the ultimate cost, and the weird destiny waiting for the First Lensman. First Lensman is the sequel to Triplanetary, and the second book of E.E. "Doc" Smith's classic [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series).

<summary>Atlantis. By Gerhart Hauptmann, 1912</summary>

### Atlantis  (13:59)  
https://librivox.org/atlantis-by-gerhart-hauptmann/  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17241  
By [Gerhart Hauptmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann) (1862 - 1946)  Published 1912
Translated by **Adele Szold Seltzer** (1876 - 1940)  
Summary from Librivox:  
Frederick von Kammacher is a young doctor in Germany whose wife has gone insane, whose children are in a boarding school, and whose career has been destroyed by some faulty research he has done. He becomes infatuated with a teenage dancer, and on a whim he boards the the same steamship the dancer is on bound for New York. Hauptmann was heralded as a seer for his description of what happens to their steamship mid-ocean, and what in reality happened to the Titanic only months later.

<summary>The Color of a Great City. By Theodore Dreiser, 1923</summary>

### The Color of a Great City  (8:36)  
https://librivox.org/the-color-of-a-great-city-by-theodore-dreiser/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61043  
By [Theodore Dreiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser) (1871 - 1945)  published 1923  
Reading Notes: [Dreiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser) wrote these essays about New Yorkers in the context of his time.  They are interesting descriptions of *late 19th century* New York, by a writer with few whose prejudices and *scientific* understanding are unfiltered.  These essays are not for everyone, but may help construct/fortify one's understanding of this time period -- proviging useful color and context for additional reading of this time period.  
Librivox Summary:  This non-fiction work takes place in many areas of New York City in the early 20th Century. Dreiser writes of lives packed into cramped tenements, of the likely end, but perhaps not, of an affair, of those who guided ships through turbulent waters, and of life in a home for retired seamen. We're taken to the new subways where track workers risked deadly accidents as they struggled to earn a living. Animal slaughter, the glory and heartbreak of song-writing, the shabby "sandwich man", deadly jealousy in Little Italy, and much more is vividly brought to life by this brilliant author. [Summary by Lee Smalley](https://librivox.org/the-color-of-a-great-city-by-theodore-dreiser/) NOTE: There are issues of racial stereotypes and derogatory race-related terms in the text of "The Color of a Great City."

<summary>Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning. By Edward Carpenter, 1921</summary>

### Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning  (10:42)  
https://librivox.org/pagan-christian-creeds-their-origin-and-meaning-by-edward-carpenter/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561  
By [Edward Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carpenter) (1844 - 1929)  published 1921  
Reading Notes:  This book is a bit of a slog and includes quite a bit of repetition.  Carpenter identifies common "religious" language and practices across time and across cultures.  He argues that Christianity is a recent iteration of an "ancient world-religion."  "In the case of Christianity the historical period has lasted nearly 2,000 years, and, as I say, we can hardly expect or wish that it should last much longer."  He sees a deterministic evolution of humanity -- whose psychological development necessitates the emergence of a new phase where "religion" will re-incorporate the natural world, including all communities of human beings (*as opposed to the current 'individualistic' phase*).  His arguements seemed to suggest that the insane waste represented WWI signaled the end of the current phase and announced the coming of the next.  
QUOTE:  
>The whole futile and idiotic structure of commerce and industry in which we are now imprisoned springs from that falsehood of individualistic self-seeking which marks the second stage of human evolution. That stage is already tottering to its fall, destroyed by the very flood of egotistic passions and interests, of vanities, greeds, and cruelties, all warring with each other, which are the sure outcome and culmination of its operation. With the restoration of the sentiment of the Common Life, and the gradual growth of a mental attitude corresponding, there will emerge from the flood something like a solid earth--something on which it will be possible to build with good hope for the future. Schemes of reconstruction are well enough in their way, but if there is no ground of REAL HUMAN SOLIDARITY beneath, of what avail are they?  

Summary from Librivox:  
>In this work from 1921, Carpenter analyzes the origin of Christian beliefs, arguing that they are derived from pre-Christian myths and religions, rather than being new revelations to the human race. He believes that "psychologically man has evolved from simple consciousness to self-consciousness, and is now in process of evolution towards another and more extended kind of consciousness," anticipating a post-Christian era. In the penultimate chapter, "The Exodus of Christianity," he sets out his belief that for Christianity "to hold the field of Religion in the Western World is neither probable nor desirable." Chapters such as "Solar Myths and Christian Festivals," "Rites of Expiation and Redemption," and "The Saviour-God and the Virgin-Mother" analyze his tenet as seen in different contexts.

<summary>A Political Pilgrim in Europe. By Ethel Snowden, Viscountess Snowden, 1921</summary>

### A Political Pilgrim in Europe  (9:34)  
https://librivox.org/a-political-pilgrim-in-europe-by-mrs-philip-snowden/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68238/  
By [Ethel Snowden, Viscountess Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Snowden) (1881 - 1951)  published 1921  
Reading Notes:  Snowden invests quite a bit of time in describing or just mentioning by name individuals she met or just saw in her travels.  Not being sufficiently well read on this period, I assume that I was unable to draw some of the context that these mentions may have for others (*my being unwilling to research each one of these personalities*).  That said, her descriptions of what she saw and heard of conditions around Europe in the years following WWI provide some depth and color missing from many formal WWI *Histories*.  Snowden also appears to incorporate a heavy load of 19th century wealthy-ruling-class culture -- which, I think, should be considered when reading or listening to her observations and analysis.  It is difficult to understand her noted *pacifism* with her acceptance of (*almost justification of*) the socialist/communist terrorism engulfing Russia at the time.  Snowden's analysis of and hopes for Communist Russia during these murderous years support Galeazzi's summary below  -- that "Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure."  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Written in the aftermath of Word War I, Viscountess Snowden recounts her travels in post war Europe in, as she describes it, "an attempt to do what one person might do, or at least attempt, to restore good feeling between the nations and the normal course of life as quickly as possible." An outspoken pacifist, socialist, and feminist who nonetheless strongly denounced the Bolsheviks, Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure. whose views and observations offer a unique perspective on Europe in the '20s.

>A personal account of the American author's visit to Europe in January 1915 while a war correspondent in Belgium for The Saturday Evening Post. She writes: "War is not two great armies meeting in a clash and frenzy of battle. It is much more than that. War is a boy carried on a stretcher, looking up at God's blue sky with bewildered eyes that are soon to close; war is a woman carrying a child that has been wounded by a shell; war is spirited horses tied in burning buildings and waiting for death; war is the flower of a race, torn, battered, hungry, bleeding, up to its knees in icy water; war is an old woman burning a candle before the Mater Dolorosa for the son she has given.

By [William Parsons Warburton](https://warburton.one-name.net/clans/Garryhinch/ps01/ps01_052.html) (1826 - 1913)  Published 1908  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Edward III reigned for fifty years, from 1327 to 1377. William Warburton writes that "the backbone of the story of his reign and times is the great Continental war...He was a genuine Englishman in his rough and ready, and often incoherent policy; in his contempt for foreigners and his audacious confidence in himself and his countrymen; in his love of manly exertion; his personal pride and popular sympathies, and his freedom from lasting enmity and vindictiveness...It is in vain for cold reason to contend against the spell of the names of Creci and Poitiers; they will forever stir the English heart like the blast of a trumpet or the rustle of a consecrated banner; but these battles are not, after all, the true titles of the age to honour. Searching deeper down we shall find, and thankfully admit, that the century was one not of conquest, but of transition, development, emancipation, and characterised by a silent and gradual contraction of the area of privilege, and a corresponding enlargement of the area of liberty."

By [Henry Salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stephens_Salt) (1851 - 1939)  published 1890  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Henry David Thoreau was a laborer, philosopher, abolitionist, anarchist, environmentalist(?), writer, poet, and more. In popular culture he is best known for his book 'Walden', and his essay on 'Civil Disobedience.' [Phyllis Vincelli](https://librivox.org/life-of-henry-david-thoreau-by-henry-salt/) reports that this early biography by Henry Salt is highly regarded by Thoreau scholars. Be aware that this is a late 19th century biography -- little wandering and uneven.  If you can forgive that, I believe it is a useful introduction to Thoreau well read by "[PhyllisV](https://librivox.org/reader/13055?primary_key=13055&search_category=reader&search_page=1&search_form=get_results)."

>Real men don't take guff from snotty kids. Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the "We're Here", a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.  And when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life.

By [Gene Stratton-Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Stratton-Porter) (1863 - 1924)  published 1911  
Reading Notes: This *simple* story also incorporates a lot of text describing a range of North American woodland plants used for their therapeutic properties and is set in a time when they were critically important to *modern* medicine.
Summary from Librivox:  
>David Langston (a.k.a. the Harvester) is 26 years old and lives a simple life in the Midwest with his dog, cultivating and harvesting trees, plants and herbs near his home that he sells as medicinal ingredients to pharmaceutical houses. When the first bluebird arrives each spring David traditionally asks his dog whether he should remain a bachelor or find a wife. For the first time in six years the dog "advises" him to find a wife. The Harvester is not happy with this advice but that night he has a vision of a very beautiful dark-haired woman in white who slowly walks towards him and bestows a kiss. This vision immediately changes the Harvester’s perspective of his life and he then sets out on a single-minded quest to find this unknown woman whom he is certain will become his wife. But David finds that his pursuit of love is not a straightforward journey. Gene Stratton-Porter endowed the Harvester with strength, honesty, kindness and "always do the right thing" attitude. Many have likened him to Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice fame. The Harvester’s love interest, Ruth, must learn how to love, and be loved, more deeply than she could ever imagine. And with her sharp tongue, Granny dispenses much-needed advice on love and relationships. The Harvester was the #1 selling novel in 1912. The story was made into a silent movie in 1927.

### Preferred Risk (06:26)  
https://librivox.org/preferred-risk-by-frederik-pohl/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51814  
By [Frederik Pohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Pohl) (1919 - 2013) and [Lester del Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_del_Rey) (1915 - 1993)  Published 1955  
Reading Notes: This is another story expressing a thread of post-WWII "*atomic bomb-crazed*" America (*even though most of the action takes place in Italy*).  World leaders -- Insurance company executives -- are crude and violent liers, attempting to profit from *governing*.  Ethical simpleton Claims Adjuster Wills starts a new job in Naples, Italy, and sees just enough of the truth to set him on a quest for justice...  
Librivox Summary:  
>The Company insures you against everything. Everything except war, that is. But they've put an end to wars (or so they claim). The Company also controls everything. Including all the sources of weapons. The Company is dedicated to the happiness of mankind (or so they claim). Medical Treatment and Law Enforcement are just a few of the other services they provide to the entire world. Claims Adjuster Wills was a happy Company employee until his path crossed those of a man with no legs and a mysterious woman. All of a sudden, his world was turned upside down, and his decisions could determine the future of the planet. This collaborative work was originally published under the pseudonym Edson McCann. It was the winner of the 1955 Galaxy-Simon & Schuster novel contest. [Summary by Nick Bulka](https://librivox.org/preferred-risk-by-frederik-pohl/)

Text: https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15454

See the [summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_in_Imperio)  
Reading Notes:  Published in 1899, this seems like an important contribution to African American utopian literature.  This novel also incorporates a realistic spectrum of violence and racism experienced across the U.S. South.  If you can make it to the last hour of the recording, it also includes passionate arguments about the pursuit of political and economic justice.  Unfortunately, the audio book's reader has a flat, monotone presentation that is not a good match for the content of the text.  If you are able, it may be more enjoyable for many to just read the [text available on gutenburg.org](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15454).  
Librivox Summary:  
>Imperium in Imperio is a historical fiction novel by Sutton Griggs, published in 1899. The novel covers the life of Belton Piedmont, a highly educated and disciplined black man in the Jim Crow south and his role in a shadow government of black men operated out of a college in Waco, Texas.

By [Edwin L. Sabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_L._Sabin) (1870 - 1952)  Published 1917  
Reading Summary: Like a number of E.L.Sabin's works, this is *historical-fiction-for-young-readers*, and is a sweeping overview, without a lot of **exploration** detail.  It is primarily a light, shallow drama focused on a small subset of the Lewis & Clark team...  The presentation is an assembly of numerous readers, which may not bring joy to every listener.  That said, it is an entertaining story that moves along throughout.  
Librivox Summary:  
>One of the significant and astounding explorations, in 1804-1806, was the expedition under the leadership of Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William Clark opening up a trail from St. Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Coast at the mouth of the mighty Columbia River. Edwin Sabin write an engaging account of this challenging journey with ample dialogue so that it reads like an adventure story rather than just a history full of facts and figures, but he fairly represents the characters and events of the long expedition.

By [Natalie Sumner Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Sumner_Lincoln) (1881 - 1935)  published 1916  
Reading notes: This is a *thin* story with mostly *wooden* characters, with just enough forward motion to keep me a little engaged (*while doing yard work and house work*).  Its main value may be how it expresses some types of war-time anxiety early in WWI.  It may not be worth your time, as there are so many other good books...  
[Summary by Book Review Digest, v.12 (1916-1917)](https://librivox.org/i-spy-by-natalie-sumner-lincoln/):  
>Here is a novel whose pregnant caption suits these parlous times. . . . It's all about a German spy plot to steal two American inventions deemed of inestimable value for war use. One is a camera for taking a map of the country from an airship. The other is a process for making glass armor—coats of mail of interwoven mica and glass that Mauser bullets cannot penetrate. Washington, D. C., is the locale. . . . Almost everybody turns out to be a bit of a spy, and the last unraveling chapter certainly carries the element of complete surprise.

Reading Notes: This mid-20th century book's main story-line is about colonization and genetics after faster-than-light travel was available to humankind.  While the author's intent was satire, the characters remain predictable, shallow and all *surface* (*could that be the point?*).  I believe that this book may only be entertaining to those who like U.S. 1950's "*mass market*" science fiction.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Ross was a junior trader on Halsey's Planet, and had great prospects but was not happy at all. Everything smelled of decay. The whole planet seemed to be slowly disappearing, the population dwindling month by month and year by year and yet no one seemd to care or even notice. Something was very, very wrong. When the first interstellar transport in 30 years arrived on Halsey's Planet, it brought things to a head. The ship had touched on six other colony worlds - and all six had been devoid of human life. Where was everybody? It was almost as if humankind, when separated by cosmic distances from Mother Earth, could not survive. He didn't know the answer but he knew it all smelled highly of decay. Decay and Rot. This highly praised novel by C.M.Kornbluth and Frederick Pohl was first published in 1954 was seen as a wonderful satire on various trends in the society of the 1950's.

>Based on the events of the last days of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (better known as Cato the Younger) (95–46 BC), a Stoic whose deeds, rhetoric and resistance to the tyranny of Julius Caesar made him an icon of republicanism, virtue, and liberty. Addison's play deals with many themes such as individual liberty versus government tyranny, republicanism versus monarchism, logic versus emotion, and Cato's personal struggle to hold to his beliefs in the face of death [Summary from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato,_a_Tragedy). 
This play was supposedly staged by George Washington after the winter of 1778 at Valley Forge as an inspiration to his officers on self-sacrificing republican virtues. Many quotes of American revolution leaders - Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or Give me death" and Nathan Hale's "I only regret I have but one life to lose for my country" - are drawn from this play.

Librivox Summary:  
>The kind reception by the American press of the author's first journey to the great southern sea, and its republication in Great Britain and in France ... have encouraged him to give the public a companion volume, "FOUR MONTHS IN A SNEAK-BOX" ... a relation of ... a second cruise to the Gulf of Mexico ... by a different route from that followed in the "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE." This time the author procured one of the smallest and most comfortable of boats... the BARNEGAT SNEAK-BOX. This curious and stanch little craft, though only twelve feet in length, proved a most comfortable and serviceable home while the author rowed in it more than 2600 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, until he reached the goal of his voyage — the mouth of the wild Suwanee River — which was the terminus of his "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE."

<summary> Librivox Summary:</summary>  
>[John Woodhouse Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodhouse_Audubon) (1812-1862), son of the famous painter [John James Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon) and an artist in his own right, joined Col. Henry Webb's California Company expedition in 1849. From New Orleans the expedition sailed to the Rio Grande; it headed west overland through northern Mexico and through Arizona to San Diego, California. Cholera and outlaws decimated the group. Many of them turned back, including the leader. Audubon assumed command of those remaining and they pushed on to California, although he was forced to abandon his paints and canvases in the desert…. Throughout the whole of this long journey Mr. Audubon took notes of scenes and occurrences by the way. In his descriptions he exhibits the keen observation of the naturalist and the trained eye of the artist. The result is a remarkable picture of social conditions in Mexico, of birds and trees, of sky and mountains and the changing face of nature, of the barrenness of the desert and the difficulties of the journey, of the ruined missions of California, of methods of mining, and of the chaos of races and babel of tongues in the gold fields. It was manifestly impossible to keep a daily journal, and the entries were made from time to time as opportunity occurred. Considering the circumstances under which they were taken, the notes are remarkable for their accuracy. Because it was not edited by Audubon, the text (and this recording) ends abruptly. - ([Summary by [Book Introduction](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/58575/pg58575-images.html#Page_11) and [David Wales](https://librivox.org/audubons-western-journal-1849-1850-by-john-woodhouse-audubon/))

<summary> Librivox Summary:</summary>  
>Rodin has pronounced Rilke's essay the supreme interpretation of his work. (From the translators’ Preface)  

Auguste Rodin, 1840-1917, was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art. Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. … Rodin… modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. From the unexpected realism of his first major figure… to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist.  

Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was a Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist, "widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets", writing in both verse and highly lyrical prose. Several critics have described Rilke's work as inherently "mystical"…. [Rilke’s] encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved in the sculpture of Rodin, and then with the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation… - ([Summary from the Foreword by Herman George Scheffauer](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61284))

>This book was first published in 1897. It's a short work, but it encompasses a vast subject—nothing less than determining the detailed geographical plan of our entire world! In the process, Jacobs feeds us dates and names and events and places and maps in a dense stream. It's a bit like drinking from a fire hose, but see it through, and the reader (or listener) will acquire a surprisingly complete overview of world history as well as geography. It's well worth absorbing, even by those not so geographically inclined, if only as a source for winning endless bar bets. Beginning in ancient times, the author identifies three main forces that have contributed to our present understanding: wars of conquest, competition for trade, and (eventually) pure scientific curiosity. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, early Greeks, Babylonians, and many other Mediterranean peoples contributed, often unwillingly, the streams of knowledge that Ptolemy of Alexandria summed up in the great Ptolemaei Orbis (ca.150 AD), the first “real” map of the whole known world. The evolution of world maps to incorporate (and sometime conceal) new discoveries is a key theme of this fascinating work.

Summary from Librivox:  
>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by Vicente Blasco Ibañez and translated into English by Charlotte Brewster Jordan, depicts two branches of a family with its roots in the pampas of Argentina. The wealthy Argentinian, Julio Madariaga, comes from Spain and raises himself from poverty, becoming a self-made, wealthy cattleman. He is a man of extremes; an honest man with a rascally knack for taking advantage of others; a self-made man with overweening pride, prejudices, and a sharp, flinty temper that can spark into violence, he is at the same time given to great generosity toward those who are under him. This almost feudal lord has two daughters who marry expatriates, a Frenchman and a German.  Julio Madariaga leaves his stamp on these two families who, after his death, return to the native countries of his two sons in law. At that time, the mood of Europe is in many ways similar to that of the old gaucho, a mixture of generosity, explosive anger, romanticism, strong prejudices, and wounded pride, a mood composed of extremes painted on an oversized canvas. World War I is waiting in the wings and will leave its own stamp on the old gaucho's lineage, pitting them against each other on opposite sides in the violent first year that many think will last only a few months but will, in fact, result in improbable destruction and loss of lives. An old Russian visionary given to drink, looks out on red skies one day and experiences its coming in a vision: hoofbeats; and riders.

Summary on Librivox:  
It was not long before the fame of the colored soldiers of America was wafted over the whole world and everywhere received by all lovers of freedom with most hearty applause. (Summary by narrator, p 66)
Summary from the Preface:  
For a number of years it has been on my mind to write a book regarding the principal events that have occurred to the colored race since the beginning of the agitation against slavery, going on from thence to the great Rebellion, passing through that war, and also dealing with all subjects of great importance that have arrested our attention under our glorious freedom. At the same time it has occurred to me . . . that my book would be far more interesting to the general reader, if I were to select a representative woman of our own race, and make her the mouthpiece of all I wished to say. . . . I hope those members of the general public who favor me by a perusal of my book will be pleased with my plan.
