Reading Notes: Anyone interested in the early stages of [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) should consider this book.  Largely assembled using newspaper and diary content from Germany, [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Czechoslovak_Republic), Poland and England, Taylor builds a broad view into "*people's*" interests and focus as [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) [and his senior team led *his country* into the last moves leading to war with neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II).

OverDrive [Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/257554/abigail-adams):  
>Abigail Adams offers a fresh perspective on the famous events of Adams's life, and along the way, Woody Holton, a renowned historian of the American Revolution, takes on numerous myths about the men and women of the founding era. But the book also demonstrates that domestic dramas-from unplanned pregnancies to untimely deaths-could be just as heartbreaking, significant, and inspiring as the actions of statesmen and soldiers. A special focus of the book is Adams's complex relationships: with her mother, sisters, and children; with her husband's famous contemporaries; and with Phoebe, one of her father's slaves. At the same time that John exhibited his own diplomatic skills on a better-known canvas, Abigail struggled to prevent the charitable gifts she gave her sisters from coming between them. In a departure from the persistently upbeat tone of most Adams biographies, Holton's work shows how frequently her life was marred by tragedy, making this the deepest, most humanistic portrayal ever published. Using the matchless trove of Adams family manuscripts, the author steps back to allow Abigail to respond to her many losses in her own words. Holton reveals that Abigail Adams sharply disagreed with her husband's financial decisions and assumed control of the family's money herself-earning them a tidy fortune through her shrewd speculations (this during a time when married women were not permitted to own property). And he shows that her commitment to women's equality and education was intense and explicitly expressed and practical, from the more than two thousand letters she wrote over her lifetime to her final will (written in defiance of legislation prohibiting married women from bequeathing property). Alternately witty, poignant, and uplifting, Holton's narrative sheds new light on one of America's best-loved but least-understood icons.

### Advance Agent.  (1:20)  
https://librivox.org/advance-agent-by-christopher-anvil/  
Text: https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/51273  
By [Christopher Anvil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Anvil) (1925 - 2009)  
(published in "Galaxy Science Fiction." February 1957)  

Reader's Notes:  This story starts with the assumption that all resources of the universe are targets for human exploitation and consumption.  Add worm holes for faster-than-light travel, formalized *survival-of-the-fittest* population control, and engineering/re-engineering of humans, and you have a story that can be read on many levels and might meet the interests of many Science Fiction listeners.

### The Age of Elizabeth. (07:35)  
https://librivox.org/the-age-of-elizabeth-by-mandell-creighton/  
Text: https://archive.org/details/ageelizabeth07creigoog  
By [Mandell Creighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandell_Creighton)  (1843 - 1901)  

Reader Notes:  
This book invests a lot of effort in establishing some of the context surrounding the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  These include, but are not limited to: The evolution of religion in Germany, England, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the rise of Protestantism.  Catholic reaction to these changes.  France, England, and Scotland.  Key personalities involved.  The Jesuits, and more.  It was an enjoyable listen and I *learned* a lot.  The author builds a confident narrative throughout.  But it is important to keep in mind that this book was published in 1875, and more current examinations of this period may build varying narratives...  
Librivox Summary:  
>This short history by the eminent British historian, Mandell Creighton, places Elizabeth and her reign within the context of 16th century European political, religious, and military events. Elizabeth overcomes her two great rivals, King Philip of Spain and Mary, Queen of Scots. England gradually unites behind her Queen, who survives multiple assassination plots. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the English, lightly taxed by their frugal sovereign, launch flourishing commerce enterprises. The author writes of the Protestant Reformation that "a change of belief meant a revolt from authority." In this age of individualism, personal daring, and a consciousness of national greatness, the golden age of Elizabethan literature breaks new ground in historiography, literary theory, poetry, and above all, drama. - ([Summary by Pamela Nagami, M.D.](https://librivox.org/the-age-of-elizabeth-by-mandell-creighton/))

https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/

Text at: https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/432  
By [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James) (1843 - 1916), published 1903  

Reading Notes: I recommend this excellent 19th century novel to anyone who has the time to think about their place and role in the world...  
[Summary from Librivox](https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/):  
>"Henry James considered The Ambassadors his best, or perhaps his best-wrought, novel. It plays on the great Jamesian theme of the American abroad, who finds himself in an older, and some would say richer, culture that that of the United States, with its attractions and dangers.  Here the protagonist is Lambert Strether, a man in his fifties, editor of a small literary magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, who arrives in Europe on a mission undertaken at the urging of his patron, Mrs. Newsome, to bring back her son Chadwick.  That young man appears to be enjoying his time in Paris rather more than seems good for him, at least to those older and wiser.  The novel, however, is perhaps really about Strether's education in this new land, and one of his teachers is the city of Paris -- a real Paris, not an idealized one, but from which Strether has much to learn.  Chad Newsome, of course is there too, and so are a scattering of other Americans, his old friend Waymarsh and his new acquaintance Maria Gostrey among them.  Had Strether his life to live over again, knowing what he has now learned, how different would it be? and what are the lessons he takes home with him?"  -  Summary from: https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/

### America Before -- The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization. (17:00)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/4248087/america-before  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/4334563/america-before  
By [Graham Hancock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hancock)  (1950 – )  

Reading Notes: An overly-long, but interesting argument about a theorized ancient civilization that seeded the cultures across the globe that followed. The author includes a lot of "what if" speculation that may not mix well with the "*sciency*" stuff for some.  

Author's Summary: [https://grahamhancock.com/america-before/](https://grahamhancock.com/america-before/?trk=public_post_comment-text)  

[Overdrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4248087/america-before): 
>We've been taught that North and South America were empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago—amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago—many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere.  Hancock's research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient "New World" cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected "Old World" cultures. Have archaeologists focused for too long only on the "Old World" in their search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the "New World"?America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization is the culmination of everything that millions of listeners have loved in Hancock's body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today.

Reading Notes: [The Andromeda Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Evolution) is a fast moving, entertaining technothriller.  If you like the genera, this seems like a good match. It is the fourth novel published after [Michael Crichton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton)'s death in 2008, and is a sequel to his 1969 novel "[The Andromeda Strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Strain)."

See the Wikipedia Summary of [The Andromeda Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Evolution).  
[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4608846/the-andromeda-evolution): 
>The Evolution is Coming.  
>In 1967, an extraterrestrial microbe came crashing down to Earth and nearly ended the human race. Accidental exposure to the particle—designated The Andromeda Strain—killed every resident of the town of Piedmont, Arizona, save for an elderly man and an infant boy. Over the next five days, a team of top scientists assigned to Project Wildfire worked valiantly to save the world from an epidemic of unimaginable proportions. In the moments before a catastrophic nuclear detonation, they succeeded.  
>In the ensuing decades, research on the microparticle continued. And the world thought it was safe...  
>Deep inside Fairchild Air Force Base, Project Eternal Vigilance has continued to watch and wait for the Andromeda Strain to reappear. On the verge of being shut down, the project has registered no activity—until now. A Brazilian terrain-mapping drone has detected a bizarre anomaly of otherworldly matter in the middle of the jungle, and, worse yet, the tell-tale chemical signature of the deadly microparticle.  
>With this shocking discovery, the next-generation Project Wildfire is activated, and a diverse team of experts hailing from all over the world is dispatched to investigate the potentially apocalyptic threat.  
>But the microbe is growing—evolving. And if the Wildfire team can't reach the quarantine zone, enter the anomaly, and figure out how to stop it, this new Andromeda Evolution will annihilate all life as we know it.

### The Anomaly. (10:00)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6104021/the-anomaly  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6093663/the-anomaly  
By [Hervé Le Tellier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv%C3%A9_Le_Tellier)  (1957 – )  

Reading Notes: At the outset, this story may seem like an extended series of lightly-connected expert-level creative writing exercises.  Stick with it.  About four hours in -- yes "**4**" -- we begin to get some important context, and I think that the story becomes one that should hold your interest (and more).  It did mine.  After thinking about this book a little, to me it has parallels to a vast chapel ceiling by Michelangelo at his peak -- via the written word.  I wonder what sparks, what raging fires of creativity and supporting knowledge, craft and effort propel the author to *this* result.  "[The Anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anomaly_(novel))" is the first work by [Hervé Le Tellier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv%C3%A9_Le_Tellier) that I have read/heard.  This seems like an important book for the aLe Tellier's sensitivity to culture and the breadth of cultures he incorporated into the story.  Again and again that silent question surfaced -- "how did he do that?"  (*if you really need to know more about the story before deciding to read it, see the [Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anomaly_(novel)) or the [summary on Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/media/6093663/the-anomaly)*).

eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/8918095/arch-conspirator  
By [Veronica Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Roth)  (1988 –  )  

Reading Notes: This short story (*3 hours*) incorporates many kinds of loss -- in the end, most of the characters choose their death.  This is probably not a story for the already depressed.  

Summary from [the author's book website](https://veronicarothbooks.com/books/arch-conspirator/):  
>Outside the last city on Earth, the planet is a wasteland. Without the Archive, where the genes of the dead are stored, humanity will end.  Antigone's parents -- Oedipus and Jocasta -- are dead. Passing into the Archive should be cause for celebration, but with her militant uncle Kreon rising to claim her father's vacant throne, all Antigone feels is rage. When he welcomes her and her siblings into his mansion, Antigone sees it for what it really is: a gilded cage, where she is a captive as well as a guest. But her uncle will soon learn that no cage is unbreakable. And neither is he.

Reading Notes: This is an excellent essay.  Read or listen to it.  

[Overdrive Summary]():  
>(Barbara McQuade) breaks down the ways disinformation has become a tool to drive voters to extremes, disempower our legal structures, and consolidate power in the hands of the few. American society is more polarized than ever before. We are strategically being pushed apart by disinformation-the deliberate spreading of lies disguised as truth-and it comes at us from all sides: opportunists on the far right, Russian misinformed social media influencers, among others. It's endangering our democracy and causing havoc in our electoral system, schools, hospitals, workplaces, and in our Capitol. Advances in technology including rapid developments in artificial intelligence threaten to make the problems even worse by amplifying false claims and manufacturing credibility. In Attack from Within, legal scholar and analyst Barbara McQuade, shows us how to identify the ways disinformation is seeping into all facets of our society and how we can fight against it. Disinformation is designed to evoke a strong emotional response to push us toward more extreme views, unable to find common ground with others. The false claims that led to the breathtaking attack on our Capitol in 2020 may have been only a dress rehearsal. Attack from Within shows us how to prevent it from happening again, thus preserving our country's hard-won democracy.

Reading Notes:  This travel journal provides a little access into the brutality of cross-country travel in 1849 in what is now the Southern and Western United States.  
Librivox Summary:  
>"[John Woodhouse Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodhouse_Audubon) (1812-1862), son of the famous painter [John James Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon) and an artist in his own right, joined Col. Henry Webb's California Company expedition in 1849. From New Orleans the expedition sailed to the Rio Grande; it headed west overland through northern Mexico and through Arizona to San Diego, California. Cholera and outlaws decimated the group. Many of them turned back, including the leader. Audubon assumed command of those remaining and they pushed on to California, although he was forced to abandon his paints and canvases in the desert…. Throughout the whole of this long journey Mr. Audubon took notes of scenes and occurrences by the way. In his descriptions he exhibits the keen observation of the naturalist and the trained eye of the artist. The result is a remarkable picture of social conditions in Mexico, of birds and trees, of sky and mountains and the changing face of nature, of the barrenness of the desert and the difficulties of the journey, of the ruined missions of California, of methods of mining, and of the chaos of races and babel of tongues in the gold fields. It was manifestly impossible to keep a daily journal, and the entries were made from time to time as opportunity occurred. Considering the circumstances under which they were taken, the notes are remarkable for their accuracy. Because it was not edited by Audubon, the text (and this recording) ends abruptly." - ([Summary by [Book Introduction](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/58575/pg58575-images.html#Page_11) and [David Wales](https://librivox.org/audubons-western-journal-1849-1850-by-john-woodhouse-audubon/))

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin  
By [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Maria_Rilke) (1875 - 1926)  
Translated by [Jessie Lemont](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Jessie_Lemont) (1862 - 1947)  

Reading Notes:  This is not a traditional biography.  It is worth a couple hours while pulling weeds, gardening, dusting, etc. but I cannot recommend it to anyone wanting a 'traditional' biography of Rodin or a review of his artistic work.  

Librivox Summary:  
>Rodin has pronounced Rilke's essay the supreme interpretation of his work. (From the translators' Preface)  

>Auguste Rodin, 1840-1917, was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art. Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. … Rodin… modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. From the unexpected realism of his first major figure… to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist.  

>Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was a Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist, "widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets", writing in both verse and highly lyrical prose. Several critics have described Rilke's work as inherently "mystical"…. [Rilke's] encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved in the sculpture of Rodin, and then with the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation… - ([Summary from the Foreword by Herman George Scheffauer](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61284))

Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8677  
By [Louisa May Alcott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisa_May_Alcott) (1832 - 1888)  
Reader Notes:  First, see the [Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_a_Mask).  This may be more than a simple 19th century family drama.  Jean Muir manipulates males who range from their late teens to (*maybe*) their middle sixties -- men who do her bidding in *virtually* total self-interest, the desire to "have her."  As a male reader, this all seemed a little *too easy*, *too convenient*.  Yet, Ms. Alcott may have been more successful at building (*and crushing*) widely assumed male and female archetypes.  In any case, she leaves much of the Coventry family damaged.  And left the reader wondering how these characters went about their roles in mid-19th century British society...  
Wikipedia Summary:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_a_Mask  
Librivox Summary:  
>"Fans of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women will remember that her heroine Jo wrote racy novels before turning her hand to more "serious" literature. Alcott, writing under the pseudonym A. M. Barnard, often did the same, and Behind a Mask (1866) is one of her sensation novels. It focuses on Jean Muir, who enters the home of the wealthy Coventry family as governess to their sixteen-year-old daughter. But is the beguiling Miss Muir all that she seems to be?"

Gladwell created it as an audio experience first, only then building a written book. It incorporates lots of recorded, first person voices of major characters in his story about the invention of modern high-altitude precision bombing, sound effects and music.  He explores the birth of this idea in the 1930s as a response to the immoral slaughter of millions in WWI.  Technology and culture got in the way of its implementation in WWII, but it has become a "normal" part of war-fighting more recently.  The author argues that its existance forces a range of moral and ethical questions onto decision-makers.

Reader's Notes:  
This is an interesting book.  See the Wikipedia and Teixeria reviews below...  
Librivox Summary:  
>The Book of Tea is as much about philosophy, religion and art as it is about a drink made with dried leaves in boiling water. It traces the development of tea into teaism. The author's first paragraph summarizes the whole book:  “Tea began as a medicine and grew into a beverage. In China, in the eighth century, it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements. The fifteenth century saw Japan ennoble it into a religion of aestheticism--Teaism. Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.”  The author shows that the philosophy of Teaism, which was developed from Japanese Zen Buddhist teachings, actually has deeper roots in Chinese Confucianism and Taoism as well.  After its publication in 1906 The Book of Tea provided a window into Japanese culture, and furthered a better understanding and appreciation of the philosophy behind minimalism in Japanese art, architecture, design and living.

See [The Giver of Stars](https://mccright.github.io/rrl/AudioBooks/#the-giver-of-stars-1352) below.]  The story follows Cussy Mary Carter, aka "Bluet," one of the "blue-skinned" people of Kentucky [see [Blue Fugates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Fugates) to learn more], whose skin appears blue due to [a rare genetic disorder - methemoglobinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methemoglobinemia), as she serves her library clients in the isolated hills/mountains around Troublesome Creek.  This is complicated by the fact that she is considered "colored" and shunned by the white community and she understands that many types of *offences* could result in the [lynching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching) of her or her father.  In 1936 she is 19 years old and her sick, coal miner father wants to marry her to a local (*almost any local*) before he dies.  A couple members of a large local clan end up dead in circumstances that are tied to the Carters and the local "Doc" promises to help them if Bluet will participate in some medical testing at a hospital in Lexington. Th testing leads to "treatment" for Cussy Mary which renders her skin temporarily "white." This treatment involves side-effects that interfere with Bluet's library duties, and Bluet's  experience as "white," and "normal", does not change the local's prejudice against her. The story brings us into the lives of a collection of poor, rural, isolated Eastern Kentucky resident's lives, and like [The Giver of Stars](https://mccright.github.io/rrl/AudioBooks/#the-giver-of-stars-1352) below this story evolves from an [historical drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama) to something like an [historical romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_romance) as the book progressed.  There is, though, plenty of conflict, friendship, loyalty, injustice and justice, and complex grit to make a good story throughout.

<details><summary>Booth. By Karen Joy Fowler. 2022 </summary>

### Booth (13:42, 470 pages)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6328747/booth  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6413265/booth  
By [Karen Joy Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Joy_Fowler)  (1950– )  

Reading Notes: This book follows the [Booth family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth_family) through early and mid-19th century during an especially turbulent time in America. Father, [Junius Brutus Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Booth) was a famous actor.  He was also a drunk and a manipulator.  "*Mother*," his mistress, fled England with him to Maryland where they had ten children, four of whom died young. The daughters Rosalie (*the least fact-based/most fictional of the characters*) and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Booth_Clarke) (*who later became a poet and writer*) remained close to home, and three of the sons [June (Junius Jr.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Booth), [Edwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Booth) and [John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth) follow their father into the acting business.  The "*John Wilkes Booth*" that we all learned about in one or another school history class is not the center of this novel.  He is a member -- *a favored member* -- of the family, and one of the boys who dives into acting, a tough business for anyone, and a trial for a flawed actor. ...who is a traitor in the Civil War and goes on to murder President Lincoln.  After Lincoln's assissination, the family wares the stain of John Wilkes' treason and of the Confederate white supremacy that fueled it.  
I liked this novel a lot more than some professional reviewers -- for example analysis shared by NYT Book Critic [Molly Young](https://www.nytimes.com/by/molly-young) in her [March 2022 review](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/books/review-booth-karen-joy-fowler.html).  I agree with M.Young's facts, but don't conclude that they result in or represent weakness and/or sloth in the story-telling...  I think that Karen Joy Fowler tells a excellent story about a complex family during a complex period in U.S. history.  

OverDrive Summary:  
>"In 1822, a stage is set: Englishman Junius Booth - celebrated Shakespearean actor and man of mesmerising charm and instability - moves to a remote cabin outside Baltimore with his wife, who bears him ten children. Of the six who survive infancy, one is [John Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilkes_Booth) - the hot-tempered but much-loved middle son who, in 1865, fatally shoots Abraham Lincoln in a Washington theatre, changing the course of history. What makes a murderer? His family or the world? And how can those who love him ever come to terms with his actions? Strikingly relevant to the world today, Booth is the story of one extraordinary family and the terrible act that shattered their bonds forever."

Eugene Manlove Rhodes (1869 – 1934) was an American writer, nicknamed the "cowboy chronicler". He lived in south central New Mexico when the first cattle ranching and cowboys arrived in the area; when he moved to New York with his wife in 1899, he wrote stories of the American West that set the image of cowboy life in that era. Originally Published under the title of Bransford In Arcadia Or The Little Eohippus (1913).

By [Bartolomé de las Casas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas) (1484 - 1566)  

Reading Notes: This report covers an ugly period of Western colonization and widespread genicide.  In roughly a 50-year period, the Spanish, the Catholics, and their surrogates killed millions of indigenous peoples in what is now the Americas.  From that perspective, it provides a contemporary, sometimes first-hand account of a period of which one should maintain a threshold understanding.  Written in the 16th century for delivery to the Spanish king and then translated (possibly serially), this report is constructed in a manner unfamiliar and not particularly attractive to me.  In addition, the recording was uneven and made this book a difficult slog.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>"A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Spanish: Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias) is an account written by the Spanish Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas in colonial times and sent to then Prince Philip II of Spain. One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and his concern for the souls of the Native Peoples. The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he describes, have inflicted a great loss on the indigenous occupants of the islands." - ([Summary by Wikipedia](https://librivox.org/a-brief-account-of-the-destruction-of-the-indies-by-bartolome-de-las-casas/))

There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.  And when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life.

eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/5257052/caste  
By [Isabel Wilkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Wilkerson)  (1961 -  )  

Reading Notes:  Regardless of your age, social or economic situation read this book. If you can, read it before you vote next time (*if you are allowed to vote*).  It ought to be required reading for High Schools/Colleges across the globe (*I know that it would have helped me think through issues about what was clearly unfair treatment of many humans that I saw around me at that age*).  Wilkerson argues that a set of common features characterize caste systems across various societies -- "caste" being the "stubbornly fixed hierarchy of human value" expressed in our behaviors, our perceptions of the world around us, in our laws and conventions, and more.  She goes on to illustrate and support her model with examples from three caste systems: India, Nazi Germany and the United States.  
Wilkerson's model involves eight "pillars of caste" (*features of caste systems in various societies*): Divine will, Heritability, Endogamy (*sex or marriage between castes is prohibited*), Purity and pollution (*the dominant caste must be "pure"*), Occupational hierarchy, Dehumanization and stigma, Terror and cruelty, Inherent superiority and inferiority of castes.

OverDrive Summary:  
>'The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power - which groups have it and which do not'
Beyond race or class, our lives are defined by a powerful, unspoken system of divisions. In Caste, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson gives an astounding portrait of this hidden phenomenon. Linking America, India and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson reveals how our world has been shaped by caste - and how its rigid, arbitrary hierarchies still divide us today.  With clear-sighted rigour, Wilkerson unearths the eight pillars that connect caste systems across civilizations, and demonstrates how our own era of intensifying conflict and upheaval has arisen as a consequence of caste. Weaving in stories of real people, she shows how its insidious undertow emerges every day; she documents its surprising health costs; and she explores its effects on culture and politics. Finally, Wilkerson points forward to the ways we can - and must - move beyond its artificial divisions, towards our common humanity.
Beautifully written and deeply original, Caste is an eye-opening examination of what lies beneath the surface of ordinary lives.

Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31592  
By [Joseph Addison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Addison) (1672 - 1719)  published 1712  

Listening Notes: This recording is **not** an example of the excellence that can be found across much of librivox.org.  If you want to understand this story, it may pay to [read it](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31592). I found the performance distracting from the content of the play, rather than enhancing it.  

[Summary from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato,_a_Tragedy):  
>"Based on the events of the last days of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (better known as Cato the Younger) (95–46 BC), a Stoic whose deeds, rhetoric and resistance to the tyranny of Julius Caesar made him an icon of republicanism, virtue, and liberty. Addison's play deals with many themes such as individual liberty versus government tyranny, republicanism versus monarchism, logic versus emotion, and Cato's personal struggle to hold to his beliefs in the face of death."  
[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/cato-by-joseph-addison/):  
>"This play was supposedly staged by George Washington after the winter of 1778 at Valley Forge as an inspiration to his officers on self-sacrificing republican virtues. Many quotes of American revolution leaders - Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or Give me death" and Nathan Hale's "I only regret I have but one life to lose for my country" - are drawn from this play.

Translated by [Ellen Marriage]() (1865 - 1946)  

Reading Notes: This story is one way to enhance any study of revolution and civil war in France, and more generally of French history.  Reading by Bruce Pirie makes this an enjoyable audio experience as well.  I assume that for some, there are issues with 18th/19th century female stereotypes and related derogatory terms.  
Summary on Librivox:  
>“The Chouans” (1829) was the first novel published under Balzac's own name (rather than a pen-name). It became the first book in the great work of his lifetime — the novel series titled “The Human Comedy.”  Balzac was impressed by the writings of Sir Walter Scott. Scott made Scottish history come alive by creating fictions that used real history as backdrop. Balzac's novel is set in 1799 — the year that Napoleon became First Consul of France. In the far west of France (i.e., Brittany), anti-revolutionary sentiment still simmered. The Chouans were a rustic guerrilla militia who wanted to undo the French Revolution and restore the old Bourbon monarchy. Pitted against them were the forces of the new Republic and its military (“the Blues”). Balzac researched this historical period as well as living conditions for Bretons of that time, then wove into the actual history his own fictional account of a romance between lovers from opposite factions in the dispute.  In “The Chouans,” we see an early and influential example of “historical fiction,” a genre which blossomed in popularity during the 1800s, and remains popular in today's novels and films.

By [Leslie Parry](https://www.leslieparry.com/about)  ( – )  

Reading Notes: This is a great turn-of-the-century New York City history study.  Odile and Belle Church take different paths when their mother's Church of Marvels burns down.  Belle is taken to Blackwell’s Lunatic Asylum, where she meets Alphie -- again.  Sylvan Threadgill, working on one of the lowest levels of the work-world, finds an abandoned newborn baby in the muck below a tenement house privy.  These characters' lives converge and we are taken on a journey through late nineteenth century New York City.  Leslie Parry is a skilled artisan and novelist building characters that latch onto the reader, propelling her story forward, looping back when needed, and building a world any reader can empathize with.  Some have criticized the structure and even the content of this novel -- I recommend that you ignore them and judge it for yourself.

It might be easy for a 21st century reader to pass these off as extreme parodies of British society at that time, but they seem to be expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of his readers at the time (*these were popular stories*).  As a result, the written words are facts -- as well as expressions of immoral, unethical and unprincipled, disgraceful, sometimes shocking and corrupt, even evil behaviors.

>"Meet Hamilton Cleek - man of mystery, and master of disguise and derring-do.  Cleek's exploits are, to say the least, highly improbable, but the book is enormous fun. The goodies are good and the baddies are very bad indeed, but beware - things are not always what they seem. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy a rattling good yarn!  Cleek is the central figure in dozens of short stories that began to appear in 1910 and were subsequently collected in a series of books." - ([Summary by Ruth Golding](https://librivox.org/cleek-the-man-of-the-forty-faces-by-thomas-w-hanshew/))

By [Thomas W. Hanshew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Hanshew)  (1857 - 1914)  

Reading Notes:  
Some might be repulsed by how strongly the oppression of women (via the legal and cultural structures enforcing patriarchy in late 19th/early 20th England) and oppression built around the concepts of race, caste, and class are expressed throughout the "Cleek" stories. It might be easy for a 21st century reader to pass these off as extreme parodies of British society at that time, but they seem to be expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of his readers at the time (*these were popular stories*).  As a result, they are facts -- that expressions of immoral, unethical and unprincipled, disgraceful, sometimes shocking and corrupt, even evil behaviors.  
Librivox Summary:  
>"Hamilton Cleek is back - or is he?  Margot, Queen of the Apaches (the notorious French criminal gang) has been released on bail and vanished, Mr. Narkom has a series of inexplicable murders to solve, there is talk of revolution in Mauravania.  And Cleek is missing.  Hold on to your hats for another thrilling ride as spying, murder, horse-napping, bombs and political intrigue rear their ugly heads." - ([Summary by Ruth Golding](https://librivox.org/cleek-of-scotland-yard-by-thomas-w-hanshew/))

Reader's Notes:  Ever so slightly interesting juvenile/young adult science fiction in which an inventor *accidently* creates a *time machine*.  The plans are stolen.  Corrupt politicians attempt advantage.  Conflict.  Resolution.  Nothing special...  It **might** be worth an hour and a quarter of your time as you work at some other *mindless* task.  Excellent reading by "quartertone."

By [Theodore Dreiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser) (1871 - 1945)  published 1923  

Reading Notes: [Dreiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser) wrote these essays about New Yorkers in the context of his time.  They are interesting descriptions of *late 19th century* New York, by a writer with few whose prejudices and *scientific* understanding are unfiltered.  These essays are not for everyone, but may help construct/fortify one's understanding of this time period -- proviging useful color and context for additional reading of this time period.  
Librivox Summary:  This non-fiction work takes place in many areas of New York City in the early 20th Century. Dreiser writes of lives packed into cramped tenements, of the likely end, but perhaps not, of an affair, of those who guided ships through turbulent waters, and of life in a home for retired seamen. We're taken to the new subways where track workers risked deadly accidents as they struggled to earn a living. Animal slaughter, the glory and heartbreak of song-writing, the shabby "sandwich man", deadly jealousy in Little Italy, and much more is vividly brought to life by this brilliant author.

By [Yume Kitasei](https://www.yumekitasei.com/)  ( – )  

Reading Notes: While this is an interesting story about one path for dealing with our near future climate/societl catastrophe -- sending ~80 young women on a voyage to a nearby star with a habital planet -- it is a little too *[young adult (YA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_literature)* for me.  Much of the storyline involves Asuka and some others working through relatively common human challenges for the first time during their unprecedented "escape" from earth.  Because these pioneers were the top picks from a global competitive process and extensive training, their difficulties dealing with the challenges of isolation from their families & friends on earth as well as working with their team at they meet the challenges of long term space flight seem like a mismatch. I stuck with the story through the end, but it left me with no joy for having done so.  If you are or know a 12 to 18 year old, this may be a much more positive experience.  

Overdrive Summary:  
>Yume Kitasei's The Deep Sky is an enthralling sci fi thriller debut about a mission into deep space that begins with a lethal explosion that leaves the survivors questioning the loyalty of the crew. They left Earth to save humanity. They'll have to save themselves first.  It is the eve of Earth's environmental collapse. A single ship carries humanity's last hope: eighty elite graduates of a competitive program, who will give birth to a generation of children in deep space. But halfway to a distant but livable planet, a lethal bomb kills three of the crew and knocks The Phoenix off course. Asuka, the only surviving witness, is an immediate suspect.  As the mystery unfolds on the ship, poignant flashbacks reveal how Asuka came to be picked for the mission. Despite struggling through training back on Earth, she was chosen to represent Japan, a country she only partly knows as a half-Japanese girl raised in America. But estranged from her mother back home, The Phoenix is all she has left.With the crew turning on each other, Asuka is determined to find the culprit before they all lose faith in the mission—or worse, the bomber strikes again.

This book is a lot of fun. And the excellent reading/acting by Joe Bergin is a huge plus. Thank you Mr. Bergin!  

[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/the-demi-gods-by-james-stephens/):  
>"In this memorialized Irish tale, 3 huge winged demi-gods (part god/part human) have descended to earth to experience human existence. They encounter Patsy Mac Can and his daughter Mary at their campfire one evening, two vagabonds who wander about Ireland with donkey and cart, eating off the land, meeting a variety of dubious characters along the way, who in the great Irish tradition of storytelling, all have stories to tell. The MacCans welcome the strangers, feed them, show them around, along the way spinning yarns and explaining their gypsy "philosophies". Those familiar with Stephens's quirky writing style appreciate him as a quick witted, keen observer, seeing both the ridiculous and the sublime in everyday things, exploring the points of view of various animals and insects as well as the human characters. Eventually the troupe parts company, having forged close bonds of friendship. This is an entertaining adult love story that would not offend a child, read charmingly by authentic Irishman Joe Bergin."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy:_An_American_Novel  
By [Henry Brooks Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams)  (1838 - 1918)  

Reading Notes: A novel about timeless characters that still seem populate the elected ranks in Washington, D.C., with an excellent reading by [Nicholas Clifford (1930-2019)](https://librivox.org/reader/4018).  
Librivox Summary:  
>"Not until after his death in 1918 was it revealed that Henry Adams was the anonymous author of Democracy, which had been published to great acclaim in 1880. Though the book avoids dates and the characters are fictitious, the setting is no doubt that of Washington in the 1870s, the age of Presidents Grant and Hayes. The young widow, Madeleine Lee, wealthy and independent, is the protagonist, who leaves her New York for Washington to turn her intelligence to politics and to see what makes her country tick. There she meets (among others) Senator Silas P. Ratcliffe of Illinois, one of the most powerful and influential (if somewhat uncultured) men of the capital, who is considering a run for the presidency, and who needs a wife to act as First Lady, a position that (he thinks) Mrs. Lee would admirably fill. Through the book Adams plays with the themes of political necessity, compromise, corruption -- particularly the kind of corporate domination of national politics that he saw becoming all too powerful. Should honest and intelligent men keep their integrity by avoiding politics? Or would that simply mean turning over the governance of the country to power-hungry, scheming, and none too honest hacks? For all the witty conversations in his novel, this was a theme that plagued Adams (a presidential grandson) in life as well as literature, and it is a theme that has by no means disappeared today." - ([Summary by Nicholas Clifford](https://librivox.org/democracy-an-american-novel-by-henry-adams/))

>Examining the two artists’ personal tragedies, social statuses, boundless productivity, and other parallels, both humorous and haunting, Hornby shows how these two unlikely men from different centuries “lit up the world.” In the process, he creates a lively, stimulating rumination on the creativity, flamboyance, discipline, and soul it takes to produce great art.

By [Murray Leinster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Leinster) (1896 - 1975)  

Reader's Notes:  
This juvenile/young adult science fiction explores the idea that *civilization* invented *the perfect* punishment system -- "*the Disciplinary Circuit*" that caused unbarable pain when applied.  The system could be applied to any targeted individual.  The author argues that any society where *the few* have the means of *perfect* control over *the many* results in terrible corruption and decay -- eventualy, self-destruction.  Leinster is optimistic, though, and has banished *criminals* rebuilding a *just* and society.  ...ignore much of the "*science*" and this may be worth its short run-time.  

Librivox Summary:  
>The Disciplinary Circuit is watching you. Always watching that your thoughts are correct and pure.  The Council want only what is best for you and society.

Reader notes: If you like spy, [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_fiction), WWII novels, this might be a good fit.  The author keeps the tension high throughout much of this story.  We follow a *super-spy* through roughly a year of his life as he guts through one unlucky turn after another.

[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/9127507/the-double-agent):  
>"Alexsi Smirnoff - a Russian orphan - was trained as an agent by the Russian Secret Service and inserted into Nazi Germany, where he rose to a position in German intelligence services. As the war grinds on, trapped between two brutal dictatorships, Alexsi betrays both sides in a desperate ploy that succeeds...and fails. His false identities burned, his life at risk, Alexsi attempts to disappear in the hills - but is caught by the British.  Recruited by the SIS, and by "C" himself, Alexsi is once again a double agent. Initially betrayed by a Soviet agent inside the SIS (Kim Philby), Alexsi is sent beyond the reach of the Soviets, into Italy with a new identity as a sergeant in the German army. Settled into the headquarters of Field Marshall Albert Kesselring, Alexsi finds himself at the nexus at a critical point in World War II, balancing between the various forces vying for control in the Vatican, the Italian resistance, and the brutal German Army determined to maintain control of Northern Italy. And Alexsi, finally forced to choose sides over his own survival.Sequel to the well-regarded A Single Spy, The Double Agent is a fast-paced, compelling novel of espionage in the most momentous and dangerous of times."

By [William Parsons Warburton](https://warburton.one-name.net/clans/Garryhinch/ps01/ps01_052.html) (1826 - 1913)  Published 1908  

Summary from Librivox:  
>Edward III reigned for fifty years, from 1327 to 1377. William Warburton writes that "the backbone of the story of his reign and times is the great Continental war...He was a genuine Englishman in his rough and ready, and often incoherent policy; in his contempt for foreigners and his audacious confidence in himself and his countrymen; in his love of manly exertion; his personal pride and popular sympathies, and his freedom from lasting enmity and vindictiveness...It is in vain for cold reason to contend against the spell of the names of Creci and Poitiers; they will forever stir the English heart like the blast of a trumpet or the rustle of a consecrated banner; but these battles are not, after all, the true titles of the age to honour. Searching deeper down we shall find, and thankfully admit, that the century was one not of conquest, but of transition, development, emancipation, and characterised by a silent and gradual contraction of the area of privilege, and a corresponding enlargement of the area of liberty."

eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/511616/eifelheim  
By [Michael Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn_(writer))  (1947 - 2023)  

Reading Notes:  One thread of this story has [cliometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliometrics) [historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian) Tom Schwoerin and partner [theoretical physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_physicist) Sharon Nagy bumble upon evidence of a mid-14th century alien crash-landing during Schwoerin's research of Eifelheim (*originally called Oberhochwald*), a small town in the Black Forest of Germany.  The main thread of the story examines relations between 14th century Black Forest Christians and scientifically-advanced aliens (*the Krenken*) whose space/time-craft crashed in the woods nearby.  It explores ideas like "What is the nature of authority?" "What is the nature of the world around us?" "What does it mean to be Christian?" "Can one change their fundamental beliefs?" and "Is the speed of light a constant?"  

RELATED:  
There is an interesting overview of VLS (variable light speed) theories in: "[New varying speed of light theories](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/66/11/R04)." 2003, By Joao Magueijo,  I downloaded on 2024-02-26 from https://web.archive.org/web/20180728224539/http://cds.cern.ch/record/618057/files/0305457.pdf.  And an earlier analysis of VLS theories: "[Cosmologies with Varying Light-Speed](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811022)." 1998, by John D. Barrow, downloaded from https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9811022.pdf on 2024-02-26.  
If you looked at either of those resources, you might want to investigate further (*what happened in the last 20 years?*).

And as recently as 2022 VLS was still receiving scientific research -- for example: "[The minimally extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL)](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1831065)." By Seokcheon Lee.  The *maths* involved in these last two papers, although important to their arguments, have enough textual context to make these papers useful to non-physicists...  

[Overdrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/137097/eifelheim):  
>Over the centuries, one small town in Germany has disappeared and never been resettled. Tom, a historian, and his theoretical physicist girlfriend Sharon, become interested. By all logic, the town should have survived. What's so special about Eifelheim?  Father Dietrich is the village priest of Eifelheim, in the year 1348, when the Black Death is gathering strength but is still not nearby. Dietrich is an educated man, and to his astonishment becomes the first contact person between humanity and an alien race from a distant star, when their ship crashes in the nearby forest. It is a time of wonders, in the shadow of the plague. Flynn gives us the full richness and strangeness of medieval life, as well as some terrific aliens. Tom and Sharon, and Father Deitrich have a strange destiny of tragedy and triumph in Eifelheim, the brilliant science fiction novel by Michael Flynn.

By [Frances A. Fuller Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fuller_Victor) (1826 - 1902)  

Reader's Notes: This is a biography of [Joseph L. Meek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Meek), born in Virginia in 1810, fur trapper in the Rocky Mountains between 1829 and 1840, as the over hunting of beaver and of other important species led to the end of that profession and put extreme pressures on Native American lives.  He then migrated to [Oregon Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country) (*later Oregon Territory*) -- having numerous *adventures* until his death in 1875.  Likely written in the late 1860s (*published in 1870*), this story is an expression of its time -- and as such, may help provide some context for more academic or professional histories of North America in the first half of the 19th century.  NOTE: Some passages in this story describe behavior that is particularly vile in its treatment of Native Americans, along with incorporating Black and Jewish stereotypes and derogatory terms.  

Librivox Summary:  
>This lively book follows the adventures of mountain man Joe Meek, from his joining the Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapping expedition in the year 1829 at the young age of 18, through his retirement from public life after serving as Marshall of Oregon Territory. Meek had close connections with many famous people of the era, such as Kit Carson, William and Milton Sublette, Jedediah Smith, Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, Dr. John McLaughlin, Oregon’s Governor Lane, and President James Polk. The author’s information came directly from interviews with Joe himself. She adds to his stories by recounting the surrounding events of the times along the way, providing an interesting way to pick up much information about the history of the Rocky Mountain region and the Oregon Territory. Meek was a tremendously colorful personality who traveled all over the wild west, and had numberless adventures. His endurance of hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and danger was legendary. Whether he was encountering bears, Indians, fellow trappers, missionaries, California gold miners, and even the president of the United States, he tells the story with humor and aplomb. Meek was always lively, often drunk, sometimes heroic, and certainly no saint. - ([Summary by Carol Pelster](https://librivox.org/eleven-years-in-the-rocky-mountains-and-a-life-on-the-frontier-by-frances-a-fuller-victor/))

Reading Notes: This is a sifi novel about how humanity and Emily - an artificial consciousness, deal with the winking-out of our sun in the near future.  There is a ton of unlikely tech and instances of ignoring the laws of the physical world, but other than that, it is enjoyable entertainment.  I think that many will find this an attractive book and listening experience.

Reading Notes: Brandon, Bo, Blue, Cas, Hal, Min, Jem, Lev, Io Emsworth.  Loss, grief, race and culture.  "*High Tech*," the monied class, grift and predatory actors.  Time travel.  The way the author deals with time travel results in a book that chops from scene to scene as it drives the story "*forward*."

[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/four-months-in-a-sneak-box-by-nathaniel-h-bishop/):  
>The kind reception by the American press of the author's first journey to the great southern sea, and its republication in Great Britain and in France ... have encouraged him to give the public a companion volume, "FOUR MONTHS IN A SNEAK-BOX" ... a relation of ... a second cruise to the Gulf of Mexico ... by a different route from that followed in the "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE." This time the author procured one of the smallest and most comfortable of boats... the BARNEGAT SNEAK-BOX. This curious and stanch little craft, though only twelve feet in length, proved a most comfortable and serviceable home while the author rowed in it more than 2600 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, until he reached the goal of his voyage — the mouth of the wild Suwanee River — which was the terminus of his "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE."

Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2309  
By [John Galsworthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galsworthy) (1867 - 1933)  

Reader's Notes:  This was an enjoyable story about a range of character *types*, family dynamics, class struggle/conflict, and more in the context of 19th/early 20th century England.  

Librivox Summary:  
>The Freelands family is a mixture: Tod Freeland is an uncommunicative gentle giant, his wife Kirsteen passionate and free-spoken, Felix is a literary man, Stanley the man of business, John is in politics. Their mother is a practical uncomprehending old lady while Nedda and Derek, the younger generation and cousins, fall head over heels in love.  The story revolves around the 'land question' which was the chief matter of moment when the novel was written – British agriculture was depressed as imported food (chiefly from the USA) meant that domestic farmers were struggling. The rich landowners pay scant attention to the wishes and rights of the labourers on their land. The Freelands find themselves on both sides of the divide and the ensuing struggle involves them all. There is therefore much social commentary in the book, but it is also a tender love story and an insight into how different members of one family can think differently while still bonded together.

### The Future  (13:00)
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/9496631/the-future  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/9511829/the-future  
By [Naomi Alderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Alderman)  (1974 – )  

Reading Notes: The author jumps back and forth in time and across what for a good chunk of this book seem like relatively independent threads of activity. Stick with her. It is worth the effort. This seems like an important *near future*, *current-trends-could-result-in-the-end-of-societies-across-the-globe* novel (*with a hopeful message that we could choose to wise-up*).  It posits, among other ideas, that a small number of corporate insiders at leading organizations could, with grit, courage, creativity and a relentless focus on goals targeting a better future for all, overcome the *current* wasteful, devisive and destructive momentum wrought by narcissistic *billionaire/business leaders*, and populations manipulated into world-destroying behaviors.  
* The story assumes that a vanishingly small number of tech giants control too much (*stuff, business activity, people, thought...*) and do so in a morality vaccum, for short term profit growth and personal power over others, without regard for the short or long term health of earth or any of the living beings, institutions or cultures existing upon it -- "[all the while loudly claiming to benefit humanity](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-11-07/in-the-future-its-billionaires-vs-cult-leaders-vs-survivalist-influencers-and-more)".  In this story, there are three primary brands within which that activity is driven: Fantail (*Facebook*), Anvil (*Amazon*) and Medlar Technologies (*Apple/Microsoft??*). The individuals *leading* these enterprises also seem to represent the broader "[unaccountable billionaire class](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/books/review/the-future-naomi-alderman.html)" sowing and nurturing division, amplifying zero-sum tribalism and boosting *waste-enhancing overconsumption* by preying on and exploiting every kind of human [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) in the hunt for greater financial and personal power returns.  

Some core characters:  
* Martha Einkorn -- who grew up in an end-times cult, the daughter of its leader, but escaped as a teenager -- has become second in command in the role of assistant to Lenk Sketlish, founder of the social network Fantail.  
* Lai Zhen -- a top tier on-line survivalist influencer -- meets Martha Einkorn at conference and the two build a complicated pairing.  
* Selah Nommik, who wrote the foundational code for data-driven purchasing giant Anvil, founded by Zimri Nommik.  
* Badger Bywater, youngest child of Ellen Bywater head of Medlar Technologies, earth's leading personal-computing corporation.  
* Albert ____, the founder of Medlar, forced out by more ambitious *and tyranical* leaders.  

A key thread of this story leads to Martha, Lai, Shelah, Badger, and Albert trying to save the world by re-working the strategic goals of their organizations and then operationalizing those goals.  How could a small group of powerful individuals get to the point where this could occur? Naomi Alderman takes us on that journey.  

Is it overly simplistic? Sure. But it is also adult, complex and dense enough to be an enjoyable read -- and maybe it will seed some alternative thinking in leaders or leaders-to-be in our most powerful tech industries.  It may also remind many that every day they are the target of immense commercial and political efforts to observe, catalogue and influence/manipulate their thoughts and behaviors (*What are the motivations and goals associated with those activities? Shouldn't we care -- and try to influence them in ways that benefit a sustainable humanity?*).  

If you have the opportunity to listen to the audio version of this book, I strongly recommend that you do so.  It is an excellent performance by a cast and crew devoted to the story as well as the listener.

Librivox Summary:  
>The Dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, in November, 1863, followed a few short months after the roiling, acrid clouds of gun smoke dissipated, leaving a little crossroads town in Pennsylvania heir to the human tragedy of over 7,000 corpses and 21,000 men suffering wounds. It was a most unnatural disaster. On November 19, the chief executive made the trip to the still-dazed, shot-torn community to deliver, almost as an afterthought (for he was not the keynote speaker), an address that clarified his belief that the Negro race should be liberated from their slavery, and that despite the loss of so much blood and life, the Union should hold to the goal of completing this emancipation. That he knew the eyes of the nation would rest of him was evident; this address was the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared in advance. But these carefully crafted words - only 269 of them - became a vital part of our nation's identity, and are a signature to the bedrock of our beliefs. - Summary by [Mark F.

Reader's notes: This is a period-piece about a small-town rural Appalachian [Kentucky coal-country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining_in_Kentucky) and a branch of the [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States) era [WPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration) traveling library with its female staff of [Packhorse Librians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_Horse_Librarians).  The story follows British Alice Wright, who marries American Bennet Van Cleve hoping to escape a highly constrained life in England.  She finds herself in another controlling environment and joins a newly forming traveling library to escape an unhappy situation, and finds herself a member of what became a small group of close friends who share a challenging job riding books throughout an extremely poor, isolated, mountainous part of Eastern Kentucky, long exploited by families who own and operate coal mining companies (one of whom is the Van Cleve family).  I am not very familiar with the [Romance genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel), but this story seemed to evolve from an [historical drama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama) to something like an [historical romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_romance) as the book progressed.  There is, though, plenty of conflict, friendship, loyalty, injustice and justice, and complex grit to make a good story throughout.

[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/8906351/the-god-of-endings): 
>"Collette LeSange has been hiding a dark truth: She is immortal. In 1834, Collette's grandfather granted her the gift of eternal life and since then, she has endured centuries of turmoil and heartache. Now, almost 150 years later, Collette is a lonely artist running an elite fine art school for children in upstate New York. But her life is suddenly upended by the arrival of a gifted child from a troubled home, the return of a stalking presence from her past, and her own mysteriously growing hunger for blood.Combining brilliant prose with breathtaking suspense, Jacqueline Holland's The God of Endings serves as a larger exploration of the human condition in all its complexity, asking us the most fundamental question: is life in this world a gift or a curse?"

### Good Morning, Midnight. (9:00)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/2467285/good-morning-midnight  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/2582590/good-morning-midnight  
By [Lily Brooks-Dalton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Brooks-Dalton)  (1987 – )  

Reading Notes: This post-apocalyptic novel is worth your time.  The story is told in the introspective voices of a late-70s, dying, once distinguished astronomer but now reclusive academic Augustine (Augie) Lofthouse and top-tier astronaut, Iris Sullivan (Sully).  Both individuals were interesting-enough to keep me engaged throughout.  Exploring the concept of survival in the context of global catastrophy also seems relevant as humans continue to pump tremendous (*almost unimaginable*) amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.  
Reports of an unexplained war result in an evacuation of Barbeau Observatory, a fictional research station in the Arctic Circle. Augie refuses to leave and remains at the observatory to continue his work -- feeling old, without any reasons to travel South and hoping to die alone.  Soon after, he sees and assumes a level of care for a young -- largely mute -- girl, Iris, who appears to have been left behind during the evacuation.  Over time silence across all communications channels leads Augie to assume there has been some sort of apocalypse, leaving Iris and him as the last people on earth. As Augie's bonds with Iris evolve he decides that they need to travel to a "nearby" weather station that had Ham radio capabilities more powerful than available the observatory.  It is a dangerous journey, but results in a more hospitible Arctic home.  After a long "settling-in" delay, Augie begins searching the airwaves for signs of life and hears astronaut Sully -- who was trying to raise any sign of human life on earth.  
Sully is on the return leg of a research survey of Jupiter and its moons.  There is in-flight drama on their ship, Aether, and increasing concern about the absence of communications signals from Earth.  Both Augie and Sully are confronted with challenges to their survival.  Both also invest heavily in reviews of their lives and evaluations of what remains important at this moment of uncertainty.

By [Whitley Strieber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitley_Strieber)  (1945 – )  

Reading Notes: This is not a great book. It incorporates a lot of stale *alien*, *UFO* and *corrupt global capitalists* vinettes linked by a story-line about Conner Callaghn & his family in small-town Kentucky and Lauren Glass & members of secret military organizations that cover up *alien* and *UFO* related information.  

From [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/media/109706/the-grays)  
>"The Grays is a mind-bending journey behind the curtain of secrecy that surrounds the subject of aliens, written by the field's great master, Whitley Strieber. If you've never so much as thought about the subject before, this book will make you think deeply, not only about the mystery of who the Grays are, but who exactly we are."

Text: https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/559  
By [John Buchan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Buchan)  (1875 - 1940)  

Reading Notes:  
This is just another relatively fast moving WWI spy novel.  It incorporates some of the worst cultural issues of the time (*written in the 2nd decade of the 20th century by a 19th century writer*)...  I believe they are expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of the readers he targeted.  He makes no attempt to deal with negative outcomes of institutionalized descrimination, colonization and war, or of cultural and literal genocide -- ignoring the value numerous peoples.  The impacts of these events continue through today.  This book may be hurtful to some.  
[Summary from Librivox](https://librivox.org/greenmantle-ver3-by-john-buchan/):  
>"Hannay is called in to investigate rumours of an uprising in the Muslim world and undertakes a perilous journey through enemy territory to meet his friend Sandy in Constantinople. Once there, he and his friends must thwart the Germans' plans to use religion to help them win the war, climaxing at the battle of Erzurum ("Erzerum" in Greenmantle)".

By [Maggie O'Farrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_O%27Farrell)  (1972 - __ )  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamnet_(novel)  

Reader Notes.  Enter one family's world, more than 4 centuries ago.  Maggie O'Farrell delivers the magic (*her expertly-tuned imagination,  skilful editing and extremely hard work*) of helping the reader join the extended family of William Shakespeare.  The primary lens for this exploration is Agnes (*Anne*) Hathaway -- William Shakespeare is only a minor supporting role.  Marriage, motherhood, power, loss & grief, along with the *daily life* in late 16th century England are made so rich, immediate, intense, and so *real* that it is easy to lose yourself in this story.  In addition to exceptional writing, the reading by [Ell Potter](https://www.beeaudio.com/narrator/ell-potter) seemed a perfect fit.

LibraryThing Reviews:  [https://www.librarything.com/work/449936/reviews](https://www.librarything.com/work/449936/reviews)  
Summary from Librivox:  
>David Langston (a.k.a. the Harvester) is 26 years old and lives a simple life in the Midwest with his dog, cultivating and harvesting trees, plants and herbs near his home that he sells as medicinal ingredients to pharmaceutical houses. When the first bluebird arrives each spring David traditionally asks his dog whether he should remain a bachelor or find a wife. For the first time in six years the dog "advises" him to find a wife. The Harvester is not happy with this advice but that night he has a vision of a very beautiful dark-haired woman in white who slowly walks towards him and bestows a kiss. This vision immediately changes the Harvester's perspective of his life and he then sets out on a single-minded quest to find this unknown woman whom he is certain will become his wife. But David finds that his pursuit of love is not a straightforward journey. Gene Stratton-Porter endowed the Harvester with strength, honesty, kindness and "always do the right thing" attitude. Many have likened him to Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice fame. The Harvester's love interest, Ruth, must learn how to love, and be loved, more deeply than she could ever imagine. And with her sharp tongue, Granny dispenses much-needed advice on love and relationships. The Harvester was the #1 selling novel in 1912. The story was made into a silent movie in 1927.

By [Annette Gordon-Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Gordon-Reed)  (1958 – )  

Reading Notes: Wow!  Using primary resources throughout, Gordon-Reed outlined and analyzes the "four generations of the African-American Hemings family, from their African and Virginia origins until the 1826 death of [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson), their master and the father of [Sally Hemings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings)' children." [*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hemingses_of_Monticello)*]  It reads like a long series of excellent university or graduate history lectures.  This seems like an especially challenging topic given the often skeletal nature of the available primary resources, the depth & breath of scholarly Jefferson historical research, and the potentcy of some facets of research and writing about white supremacy and racial power (*for example, [critical race theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory)*) -- all of which the author grapples with...  Because I view this work as a series of college lectures, the repetition that appears throughout is simply *what you do* because of the time lapse between sessions, or because the connection(s) to the current focus are so important as to warrant it.  There has been some criticism of the author's repeated "unnecessary pronouncements about human nature" which I attribute to a thorough review of specific situations as well as attempting to provide context to a readership (*or student group*) made of individuals having wildly varying backgrounds and understandings of *how the world works.*  Thirtyone hours might initially seem like a slog, but give it a chance -- it is worth the investment.

[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/201740/the-hemingses-of-monticello):  
>This epic work tells the story of the Hemingses, whose close blood ties to our third president had been systematically expunged from American history until very recently. Now, historian and legal scholar Annette Gordon-Reed traces the Hemings family from its origins in Virginia in the 1700s to the family's dispersal after Jefferson's death in 1826. It brings to life not only Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson but also their children and Hemings's siblings, who shared a father with Jefferson's wife, Martha. The Hemingses of Monticello sets the family's compelling saga against the backdrop of Revolutionary America, Paris on the eve of its own revolution, 1790s Philadelphia, and plantation life at Monticello. Much anticipated, this book promises to be the most important history of an American slave family ever written.

ebook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6889436/horse  
By [Geraldine Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Brooks_(writer)) (1955 -  )  

Reader notes:  This story follows the life (*and rediscovery*) of America’s most famous racehorse -- Lexington (*originally "Darley"*).  In the process, it also explores aspects of systemic racism in 19th, 20th, and 21st century America.  
```1850s/60s```: Harry Lewis, Jarrett (Lewis), Elisha Warfield, Richard Ten Broeck, Robert A. Alexander, and Thomas J. Scott.  
```1950s```: Martha Jackson, Lee Krasner & Jackson Pollock.  
```2019-20```: "Jess" and Theo Northam.  
Of these main characters, only Jarret, Theo and Jess are fiction.  

The story's primary threads follow Lexington and some of those who trained and cared for him (*slave and "free"*) in Kentucky, beginning in 1850, Mississippi, Louisiana, and back to Kentucky through the time of the civil war; New York City, 1954; and Washington, DC, 2019 into early 2020.  Throughout, Blacks in America are treated (*via the law, commerce, and daily life*) as something less than fully human, of less value than those *fully white* with limited (*or situational*) agency, and routinely -- almost comprehensively -- feared.  See the [Oprah Daily Review](https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/a40656831/geraldine-brooks-horse-book-review/) for a more complete summary.

### How High We Go In The Dark  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6455958/how-high-we-go-in-the-dark  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6209943/how-high-we-go-in-the-dark  
By [Sequoia Nagamatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Nagamatsu) and https://www.sequoianagamatsu.com/#about  (–)  

Reading Notes:  
This literary [science fiction-fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fantasy) dystopian novel that opens in 2030 (*Nagamatsu had worked on this story for a decade as our recent COVID pandemic arrived*)...  
A team of scientists researching climate change-driven melting Siberian Arctic permafrost uncover an ancient virus...  
Widespread panic, suffering, death and grief soon follow.  Climate change continues to impose change on people and things across the globe.  Nagamatsu tells the story through a series of interconnected first-person narratives.  Each story is at *human* scale - each a witness of and an actor in the broader pandemic + climate change crises.  Vignettes include a euthanasia theme park for dying children, a version purgatory, an empathetic talking pig, a manager of a high-rise funeral home, a failing robotic dog repair shop, a scientist whose experiments left a tiny black hole implanted in his brain, a large multi-diciplinary team on an interstellar spaceship, individual people working to build lives in a world still damaged by the pandemic, and an interesting *explanation* of how it all started.  

*Small* interconnections between the stories may help assemble these essays into something that seems like a novel, but each stands on its own.  For the most part, the main characters are developed in ways that are human, humane and exploring the emotional space left to them by the twin catastrophies.  The book is an illustration of serious story-telling talent, but it was still a slog to get through parts.  The story that explained a lot about how the earth got to the point(s) described throughout the book was worth the effort required to get there...  

Review by [Nina Allan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Allan) in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/20/how-high-we-go-in-the-dark-by-sequoia-nagamatsu-review-a-new-plague): "How High We Go in the Dark is made up of more than a dozen discrete episodes, separate beads along the narrative timeline from the discovery and release of the virus, through the worst years of the pandemic, on into its lingering aftermath. The book then leaps 6,000 years ahead, revealing how decisions taken now might lead to radically divergent futures. Each segment is told from the point of view of a different character and highlights a significant aspect of evolving reality: accelerating developments in genetic modification; a revolutionary star drive; the cultural impact of public grieving. The commercialisation of death is shown through euthanasia theme parks, elegy hotels, lost lives preserved within the plastic carcasses of robot dogs."

[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/6455958/how-high-we-go-in-the-dark):  
>In 2030, a grieving archeologist arrives in the Arctic Circle to continue the work of his recently deceased daughter at the Batagaika Crater, where researchers are studying long-buried secrets now revealed in melting permafrost, including the perfectly preserved remains of a girl who appears to have died of an ancient virus.  Once unleashed, the Arctic plague will reshape life on Earth for generations to come, quickly traversing the globe, forcing humanity to devise a myriad of moving and inventive ways to embrace possibility in the face of tragedy. In a theme park designed for terminally ill children, a cynical employee falls in love with a mother desperate to hold on to her infected son. A heartbroken scientist searching for a cure finds a second chance at fatherhood when one of his test subjects—a pig—develops the capacity for human speech. A widowed painter and her teenaged granddaughter embark on a cosmic quest to locate a new home planet.  From funerary skyscrapers to hotels for the dead to interstellar starships, Sequoia Nagamatsu takes readers on a wildly original and compassionate journey, spanning continents, centuries, and even celestial bodies to tell a story about the resilience of the human spirit, our infinite capacity to dream, and the connective threads that tie us all together in the universe.

### I Spy  (6:39)  
https://librivox.org/i-spy-by-natalie-sumner-lincoln/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9812  
By [Natalie Sumner Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Sumner_Lincoln) (1881 - 1935)  published 1916  
Reading notes: This is a *thin* story with mostly *wooden* characters, with just enough forward motion to keep me a little engaged (*while doing yard work and house work*).  Its main value may be how it expresses some types of war-time anxiety early in WWI.  It may not be worth your time, as there are so many other good books...  

[Summary by Book Review Digest, v.12 (1916-1917)](https://librivox.org/i-spy-by-natalie-sumner-lincoln/):  
>Here is a novel whose pregnant caption suits these parlous times. . . . It's all about a German spy plot to steal two American inventions deemed of inestimable value for war use. One is a camera for taking a map of the country from an airship. The other is a process for making glass armor—coats of mail of interwoven mica and glass that Mauser bullets cannot penetrate. Washington, D. C., is the locale. . . . Almost everybody turns out to be a bit of a spy, and the last unraveling chapter certainly carries the element of complete surprise.

Reading Notes: This book outlines the lives of [John Charles Frémont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont) (1813 – 1890) an American explorer, military officer, and politician and his wife [Jessie Ann Benton Frémont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_Benton_Fr%C3%A9mont) (1824 – 1902) an American writer and political activist.  This is a great introduction to a number of mid-19th century U.S. social and political movements through the writings of these two key actors.  For me, it is a fantastic popular history book -- hurray! for Steve Inskeep author and narrator.

See the [summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_in_Imperio)  
Reading Notes:  Published in 1899, this seems like an important contribution to African American utopian literature.  This novel also incorporates a realistic spectrum of violence and racism experienced across the U.S. South.  If you can make it to the last hour of the recording, it also includes passionate arguments about the pursuit of political and economic justice.  Unfortunately, the audio book's reader has a flat, monotone presentation that is not a good match for the content of the text.  If you are able, it may be more enjoyable for many to just read the [text available on gutenburg.org](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15454).  

Librivox Summary:  
>Imperium in Imperio is a historical fiction novel by Sutton Griggs, published in 1899. The novel covers the life of Belton Piedmont, a highly educated and disciplined black man in the Jim Crow south and his role in a shadow government of black men operated out of a college in Waco, Texas.

Reading Notes:  Read or listen to it.  It seems like an important book.  Much of the core action occurs in a crumbling, isolated house at the foot of Mount Kanchenjunga Kachenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain, in the Himalayas (Sai, Retired judge Jemubhai Patel and cook) and in a series of restaurants in New York (Biju) in the middle 1980s.

Librivox summary:  
>A railway engineer by training, Freeman Wills Crofts often relied on railway themes for his plots, with careful attention to details and schedules. Having retired from the railway in 1929 to devote himself full time to writing, he is considered part of the golden age of detective fiction, along with Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie. Until his death in 1957, he produced more than 30 novels, short-stories, and plays. In his fifth book in 1924, he introduced the character of Inspector Joseph French, a Scotland Yard detective whose approach to crime was far more workman-like than most other fictional sleuths. In this book, he tells the story of Maxwell Cheyne, who is mysteriously drugged in a country inn and awakens to find that his home has been burgled, although nothing is missing. As Cheyne is pursued by a gang of relentless criminals, Inspector French of Scotland Yard must untangle their mysterious conspiracy. - [Summary by ASharma](https://librivox.org/inspector-french-and-the-cheyne-mystery-by-freeman-wills-crofts/)

By [Jack London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London)  (1876 - 1916)  

Reader's Notes:  
This is a seriously-dystopian novel...  For some, it might be a useful reminder of their high school or college studies of late 19th and early 20th century social, economic and cultural struggles in the United States.  Its thumping Socialism (*and the fact that Jack London invested so much time in this story*) is a reminder of how it was, for a time, a real force in the U.S.  Written and published before 1909, it is also interesting to compare some of The Iron Heal content against the facts of American history through the 1930s.  London's overwrought prose about organized labor, mega-capitalists, and corruption throughout government institutions may make this novel radioactive for some.

Reading Notes: This story is enhanced by [Dominic Hoffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Hoffman)'s excellent audio acting/narration.  
The [historical fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction) is, in part, a retelling of "[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn)" from the perspective and voice of enslaved [Jim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_(Huckleberry_Finn)).  
It explores entrenched attitudes about race, slavery, freedom , particularly racism and freedom.  It is also about language: "`White folks expect us to sound a certain way and it can only help if we don’t disappoint them... The better they feel, the safer we are.`" Jim, treated with violence and humiliation, rarely meets violence with violence, yet retains his goodness, honor, and wisdom.

The state legislature and governor where I live have been attempting to cull all telling, even hints, of America's original sin of slavery and its ongoing impacts from public school teaching and supporting materials (*because, in part, it might result in White discomfort*). The content and telling of this story might help resist **some** of the willful ignorance and uneducated prejudice that has led to our legislator's and governor's attitudes and behaviors. This book would also be a valuable educational resource for (at a minimum) high school and college students and staff, and it is appropriate for all the rest of us who have left school behind.

Reader's Notes:  
I believe that "Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers..." will be enjoyable to [Jane Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen) fans, as well as those who loved [Patric O'Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O%27Brian)'s [Aubrey-Maturin novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series). Edith Hubback Brown and her father John Hubback share what appears to be well researched and carefully edited primary resources (British Naval records and family letters) to outline Francis and Charles Austen's naval education and careers, and how their experiences contributed to Jane Austen's novels.  
Everyone should know that this is an excellent reading/performance by [Bryn Roberts](https://librivox.org/reader/18007).  His accent, emotions, pacing, and enthusiasm are exemplary and enhance this audio book tremendously.  

Librivox Summary:  
>"Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers" by Edith & John Hubback is a biography that explores the lives of Jane Austen's two sailor brothers, Francis and Charles. The book examines their naval careers, their relationships with their famous sister, and their impact on her writing. They begin with background information on the Austen family and the naval world of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They then describe Francis's and Charles's experiences in the Royal Navy, including their participation in the Napoleonic Wars and voyages to exotic locations such as the West Indies and Australia. The Hubbacks, themselves descendants of Jane Austen, also examine the relationship between Austen and her sailor brothers, highlighting the influence they had on her writing. For example, they discuss the naval themes that appear in Austen's novels such as "Persuasion" and "Mansfield Park" and suggest that her brothers' experiences informed these works. Throughout the book, the Hubbacks use letters, journals, and other primary sources to bring the Austen brothers to life. They also provide context on the wider social and political issues of the time, including the impact of the wars on naval life and the attitudes towards sailors and their families. "Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers" offers a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two important figures in Jane Austen's world and sheds light on the naval world that inspired her writing.

The narrative is set in Poland from 1939 to 1944 and follows the campaign to eliminate Jews and to destroy all non-German culture in Poland. ... inspired by the true story of the underground library/libraries in WWII Warsaw.

>A personal account of the American author's visit to Europe in January 1915 while a war correspondent in Belgium for The Saturday Evening Post. She writes: "War is not two great armies meeting in a clash and frenzy of battle. It is much more than that. War is a boy carried on a stretcher, looking up at God's blue sky with bewildered eyes that are soon to close; war is a woman carrying a child that has been wounded by a shell; war is spirited horses tied in burning buildings and waiting for death; war is the flower of a race, torn, battered, hungry, bleeding, up to its knees in icy water; war is an old woman burning a candle before the Mater Dolorosa for the son she has given.

By [Kazuo Ishiguro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro) (1954 -- __ )  

Reader's Notes: One path for artificial intelligence in our not-too-distant future.  
We experience the story from the perspective of Klara, an AF (a solar-powered Artificial Friend).  Klara has exemplary observational skills but seems limited by what must have been her training data-set emphasizing human characteristics and communications and de-emphasizing the laws of the physical world.  This results in an *uneven* understanding of the world around her and an interesting story of committment and compassion.  
CAUTION:  Learning story details by reading the excellent [wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klara_and_the_Sun) might ruin (*maybe just "diminish"*) the reading experience for some because part of the Ishiguro's magic is in slowly, expertly, revealing new ideas and new threads of experience as the reader traverses his story.

eBook: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32004  
By [Frederik Pohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Pohl) (1919 - 2013)  

Reading Notes: Another post-WWII / post-apocalypse story filled with fairly wooden characters and dialog... The pacing and economy of Pohl's writing may place this short story above some other writing in this category, but you may need to be involved in a study of this period to find joy in reading/listening to "Knights of Arthur."    

Librivox Summary:  
>Pohl takes us into the future in this quirky and funny story, where the population of the United States is less than 10,000 people ... total. Yes you guessed it, there was a war; but the 'clean' bombs killed people and left most everything else intact. Our trio of 'Knights' are not very talented or smart or brave, but they have survived very well and now are taking on New York City to fulfill a quest of Arthur. You see, Arthur has no legs. Or arms. Or body. But he is very opinionated nevertheless. Listen to this fascinating story that is full of humor and human nature as only Pohl can do it.

"It was 2538 years After the Year of the Son of Man. For six centuries mankind had been developing machines. The Ear-apparatus was discovered as early as seven hundred years before. The Eye came later, the Brain came much later. But by 2500, the machines had been developed to think, and act and work with perfect independence. Man lived on the products of the machine, and the machines lived to themselves very happily, and contentedly. Machines are designed to help and cooperate. It was easy to do the simple duties they needed to do that men might live well. And men had created them. Most of mankind were quite useless, for they lived in a world where no productive work was necessary." - [Summary by the author](https://librivox.org/the-last-evolution-by-john-wood-campbell-jr/)

### The Last Watch.  (17:00)  
https://www.overdrive.com/media/5418299/the-last-watch  
By [J.S. (Jenny) Dewes](https://www.jsdewes.com/about)  
Reading Notes: Think the best of "The Expanse."  This is a fast-paced sci-fi adventure.  It combines enough real science/*sciencey* and technology/*techy* facts and ideas with a universe of creative *additions* to make this a *believeable* story of the far future.  It includes the conflict, heroics, and romance required for *[space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera)*.  It is also a ready-for-streaming novel.  
Throughout, the scene setup is just enough to create a skeletal environment so that the action, character development and dialog can keep the pace thumping along -- not timeless prose.  Some [GoodReads reviewers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53205794-the-last-watch) have been critical of character development -- I just viewed the pacing and scope of character development as part of writing an action-centric novel that is prepped for screen-writers, rather than what some called *thin* or *under-emphasized*.  If you require deep character development concentrated in the opening chapters of your books, "The Last Watch" may not be happiness for you...  If you can dive in and have the author reveal character details throughout the story, this book might be a good fit.  Overall, the story is told from two perspectives:  Adequin Rake, commander of the Argus (what appears to be all but a prison ship) stationed at "The Divide" -- the edge of the universe.  And Cavalon Mercer, recent arrival, the *over-educated* grandson of an *evil monarch*, who incrementally reveals unexpected abilities given his introduction into the Argus.  Changes in the expected behaviors of the known universe, warp drive maintenance and repair, controlled fusion, fantastic technology *left behind* by an ancient civilization, genetically engineered and cloned warriors, dark matter, anti-matter, and much more have *Sci-Fi-reasonable* associations with broadly *understood* physics and technology concepts that this fiction seems "*believeable-enough*" most of the time.  Close-quarter combat, governmental/military misdeeds, and corrupt monarchs & oligarchs add interest to the story.

Reading Notes: A narrowly focussed history of select leaders and select wars primarily in Germany, Italy, France and Constantinople between 1254-1494. Within its limited scope, it is an easy way to get a little context about some of the major "political" personalities and conflicts during this period in Western Europe.  It is not a resource for learning much about "life on the ground" for the overwhelming majority of people in this period.  As an audio experience, this book is also a pleasure thanks to the excellent narration by Dr. Pamela Nagami.  

Librivox Summary: 
>The Scottish historian, Robert Balmain Mowat writes, “When this period opens one of the finest epochs in German history had just closed, and a time of confusion begun.” With the death of the Emperor Frederick II, Germany’s many feudal territories became practically hereditary sovereignties, her Free Imperial Cities almost independent states. But within the walls of these city-states, as in their Italian counterparts, commercial life flourished. During this period the Great Schism divided Christendom and was with infinite difficulty resolved. This was the age of Dante, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, of the Hundred Years’ War, of the rise of Spain, and of the Turkish conquest of Constantinople. (Summary by Pamela Nagami, M.D.)

By [Rumaan Alam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumaan_Alam) and [his site](https://www.rumaanalam.com/work/about-me)  (1977 –  )  

Reading Notes: I thought that author Rumaan Alam ably built tension along several threads -- marriage, parenting, wealth, race and class -- as this end-of-the-world story progressed.  This is my first book after listening to "[Caste](#caste_isabel_wilkerson)" by [Isabel Wilkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Wilkerson) and I think her research and writing is an excellent preparation for reading Alam's novel, which explores a lot of the same social territory, albeit on a micro-scale (*having 6 or 8 material characters*) and in a fictional end-of-the-world context.  
This book was also released in [movie form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_the_World_Behind_(film)).  

Wikipedia Summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_the_World_Behind_(novel)  
Overdrive [Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/5233415/leave-the-world-behind):  
>From the bestselling author of Rich and Pretty comes a suspenseful and provocative novel keenly attuned to the complexities of parenthood, race, and class. Leave the World Behind explores how our closest bonds are reshaped—and unexpected new ones are forged—in moments of crisis.  
>Amanda and Clay head out to a remote corner of Long Island expecting a vacation: a quiet reprieve from life in New York City, quality time with their teenage son and daughter, and a taste of the good life in the luxurious home they've rented for the week. But a late-night knock on the door breaks the spell. Ruth and G. H. are an older couple—it's their house, and they've arrived in a panic. They bring the news that a sudden blackout has swept the city. But in this rural area—with the TV and internet now down, and no cell phone service—it's hard to know what to believe.  
>Should Amanda and Clay trust this couple—and vice versa? What happened back in New York? Is the vacation home, isolated from civilization, a truly safe place for their families? And are they safe from one other?

Wikipedia Biography: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Bloomer  
By Dexter C. Bloomer (1816 - 1900)  

Reader's Notes:  The fact that this is largely an edited (*by her husband*), lightly annotated collection of writings by Amelia Bloomer provides a unique, first hand account of her ideas and activities.  In addition to what you might expect (*temperance, experiments with new clothes, sufferage, and equality for women and men*) this volume includes some interesting first-hand accounts of travel in "the West" in the 1850s as well as life in Western Iowa in the mid 19th century.  

Librivox Summary:  
>As Mrs. Bloomer was one of the pioneers in what is sometimes called the “Woman’s Movement,” it seems right that a record of her work should be placed in durable form. Such a record I have endeavored to set forth in the following pages. While giving a brief narrative of her life, I have also included, as being most satisfactory, quite extended extracts from her writings; and one of her lectures is printed in full. - [Summary by D.

By [Henry Salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stephens_Salt) (1851 - 1939)  published 1890  

Summary from Librivox:  
>Henry David Thoreau was a laborer, philosopher, abolitionist, anarchist, environmentalist(?), writer, poet, and more. In popular culture he is best known for his book 'Walden', and his essay on 'Civil Disobedience.' [Phyllis Vincelli](https://librivox.org/life-of-henry-david-thoreau-by-henry-salt/) reports that this early biography by Henry Salt is highly regarded by Thoreau scholars. Be aware that this is a late 19th century biography -- little wandering and uneven.  If you can forgive that, I believe it is a useful introduction to Thoreau well read by "[PhyllisV](https://librivox.org/reader/13055?primary_key=13055&search_category=reader&search_page=1&search_form=get_results)."

Librivox Summary:  
>"Published in Planet Stories in 1946, this story is a great mix of Golden Age Sci Fi and Swords & Sorcery. The first half was written by Brackett and when she was pulled away by other commitments the publisher gave it to a new writer, Ray Bradbury, to finish. It is a sort of prequel to the Stark character developed by Brackett where a weak puny man is transferred into the body of a Conan like superman and then cruses through adventure after adventure, always rescuing damsels who are tough and feisty. The publisher blurb says "He died—and then awakened in a new body. He found himself on a world of bizarre loveliness, a powerful, rich man. He took pleasure in his turn of good luck ... until he discovered that his new body was hated by all on this strange planet, that his soul was owned by Rann, devil-goddess of Falga, who was using him for her own gain." - [Summary by Phil Chenevert](https://librivox.org/lorelei-of-the-red-mist-by-leigh-douglass-brackett-2/)"

Reading Notes:  This book is another huge winner --> you should read it.  I started this book yesterday morning and am writing this text after having finished around noon today -- it is the kind of book that quickly drew me in and kept me engaged with the characters -- and engaged with the writing itself. As this story crosses centuries and cultures I thought initially it did so via elements of what I believe is often called *[magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism)*. Zapata builds each sub-plot around a dense structure of realistic detail while injecting what at first seemed like *magical or fantastical elements.*  But the more that I thought about the details, I now believe that he just has *magical* skills -- hugging complex and diverse realities as a master story-teller and a master literary craftsman. As a reader the book seems to *argue* that the reality that our decisions result in impacts far, far beyond their immediate context.  The story incorporates themes of family, diaspora, immigration, exile, and the way we characterize cultures/societies not our own and how we treat each other first-hand, as well as ideas that support the existance of multiple *parallel* worlds that are described by quantum physics (*if you find this last idea an interesting concept and want to read more fiction incorporating it, see Neal Stephenson's "[Anathem](https://mccright.github.io/rrl/Books/#anathem_neal_stephenson)" and if you are intrigued by the idea(s) and want to learn more, see Neal Stephenson's [acknowledgments](https://www.nealstephenson.com/acknowledgments.html) page starting at "Philosophical and Scientific Ideas."*).  Jason Heller's review of this book, "[Multiple Universes Fill The Pages Of 'The Lost Book Of Adana Moreau'](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/802654221/multiple-universes-fill-the-pages-of-the-lost-book-of-adana-moreau)" is better than anything that I could write about this book -- see it if you want to know more.  This is my second book after listening to "[Caste](#caste_isabel_wilkerson)" by [Isabel Wilkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Wilkerson) and I think her research and writing is an excellent preparation for reading Zapata's novel, which explores some of the same social territory across generations.  

[Overdrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/4866858/the-lost-book-of-adana-moreau):  
>In 1929 in New Orleans, a Dominican immigrant named Adana Moreau writes a science fiction novel. The novel earns rave reviews, and Adana begins a sequel. Then she falls gravely ill. Just before she dies, she destroys the only copy of the manuscript.
Decades later in Chicago, Saul Drower is cleaning out his dead grandfather's home when he discovers a mysterious manuscript written by none other than Adana Moreau. With the help of his friend Javier, Saul tracks down an address for Adana's son in New Orleans, but as Hurricane Katrina strikes they must head to the storm-ravaged city for answers.What results is a brilliantly layered masterpiece—an ode to home, storytelling and the possibility of parallel worlds.

By [Tom Hanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks)  (1956 – )  

Reading Notes: The story, told by Joe Shaw, creative writing teacher at Montana college and sometimes reviewer, includes the birth of the source material that inspires a writer-director to write his latest movie, “Knightshade: The Lathe of Firefall,” along with the making of that movie.  Most of the characters (*Bob Falls, Robby Andersen, Bill Johnson, Allicia (Al) Mac-Teer, Ynez Gonzalez-Cruz, Wren Lane, O.K. Bailey, and more*) throughout the book are -- at varying levels of depth -- treated by the author as *real people* and (*almost*) everyone surfaces enough kindness to support the story's forward motion.  As much as anything about this story, it was the economy of that *building-real-people*, with just-enough-detail-just-enough-backstory-and-no-more that I found attractive (*some may argue with the ...and-no-more*).  Learning a little about movie-making was also interesting.  Reviewer Ron Charles [identified]() “Making movies is about solving more problems than you cause” as one of the foundational principles outlined in this story.  Being one of those foundational *rules* for success in life -- this novel may, assuming some level of optimism and decency, pass along some important messages about living well.

The book is required reading for all school students in Georgia and a copy went with each bride to her new home as a part of her dowry. This prose rendering was the first in English. - ([Summary by *Beeswaxcandle*](https://librivox.org/man-in-the-panthers-skin-by-shota-rustaveli/)

Pyramid Books edition: November, 1959  

Reading Notes:  
I agree that "old-school space opera" is a good description -- in the context of juvenile/young adult fiction.  But this book's mostly *wooden* characters remind me of "I Spy" in their shallow lack of development.  The author builds a future where Earth's colonization of many worlds seems to have emphasized transplanting some of humankind's worst tendencies...  The story maintains just enough forward motion to keep me engaged (*while doing yard work and house work*).  It may not be worth your time, as there are so many other good books...  
[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/man-of-many-minds-by-edward-everett-evans/):  
>"GALAXY IN DANGER!  Somewhere, somehow, the first moves have been made—the pattern is beginning to emerge. Someone—or something—is on the way to supreme power over all the planets held by Man.  And the Inter-stellar Corps is helpless to meet the threat—no normal man can hope to penetrate the conspiracy.  But—the Corps has a man who isn't normal, a man with a very strange weapon ... his mind. Exciting! Strange! Extraordinary! One of the most unusual science fiction adventures ever published.  Space travel, telepathy, and heroism! Military school cadet George Hanlon is selected to join an elite, super-secret, secret service organization. He has extraordinary mental powers, among them the ability to talk to animals and transfer parts of his mind into them. Old-school space opera!"

By [Lauren Groff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Groff)  (1978 - )  

Reading Notes: This excellent story begin as newly orphaned, seventeen-year-old [Marie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_de_France) from the French Royal Court of [King Henry II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_England) and his wife, [Eleanor of Aquitaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_of_Aquitaine) is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey.  It is the late 12th century, and "poverty" at that time was a mean business.  Marie adapts to this hard life and, having participated in a wider world and witnessed a broad range of opportunities, she began to help, and then lead the abby into a new age of expansion and power. Marie has religious visions and reacts to some of them with radical expansions of the abby's property and practices in an attempt to build a [female separatist "utopia.](https://www.vox.com/culture/22727057/matrix-lauren-groff-book-review)"

Overdrive Summary: Cast out of the royal court by Eleanor of Aquitaine, deemed too coarse and rough-hewn for marriage or courtly life, seventeen-year-old Marie de France is sent to England to be the new prioress of an impoverished abbey, its nuns on the brink of starvation and beset by disease. At first taken aback by the severity of her new life, Marie finds focus and love in collective life with her singular and mercurial sisters. In this crucible, Marie steadily supplants her desire for family, for her homeland, for the passions of her youth with something new to her: devotion to her sisters, and a conviction in her own divine visions...

Reading Notes: Also titled: "The Matter of Everything -- Twelve Experiments That Changed Our World."  This is *popular science* at its best!  This book *outlines* a lot about the practice of particle/high-energy/accelerator physics experiments in the last ~125 years as a way to explain how we know what we know about the working of our world and how knowledge gained along the way has tranformed our world.  And she does so in a way that is understandable, even exciting, to someone who has never had first-hand involvement in real science of any kind.  Sheehy emphasises importance of asking *good*/the right questions, seeking and nurturing collaboration (...a necessity as the scale and scope of high-energy physics experiments required enormous and extended funding as well as increasingly diverse skillsets), nurturing *pure* science (...partly because the process so often results in unexpected material benefits).  She also highlights some of the individuals (*often women*) whose contributions were too often overlooked by their contemporaries and by professional historians.  I listened to the audio book.  Dr. Sheehy is the narrator and her obvious interest and excitement about this topic is a huge asset in the presentation of this already pretty exciting story (*I can imagine her being an excellent teacher/collaborator*).  See the reviews below for more information about this fantastic book.

Short Summary on Wikipedia:  
>A man has arrived at a rail terminus, but never taken a rail car back from there. There is no evidence that he left the terminus by any means. His reported state of mind made it unlikely he committed suicide by jumping off. Mossa asks for Pleiti's help, since the man was a colleague at Valdegeld. Soon there is a murder, the victim seeming to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Continuing the investigation may put Pleiti and Mossa themselves in danger.

### The Ministry for the Future  (20:42)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/5558525/the-ministry-for-the-future  
Ebook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/5255196/the-ministry-for-the-future  
By [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson) (1952 -  )  
Published October 2020, 576 pages  

Reader Notes:  First, everyone should read or listen to this book.  Climate catastrophe remains a real threat and Robinson's book might help with context and inspiration to act (*...or act more*).  
20 million (20,000,000) people die in a 2-week heat wave in India.  Robinson's *Ministry of the Future" is established by the United Nations in order to more effectively "advocate for the world’s future generations of citizens, whose rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are as valid as our own" and "charged with defending all living creatures present and future who cannot speak for themselves, by promoting their legal standing and physical protection." (*quotes from [Gerry Canavan](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/of-course-they-would-on-kim-stanley-robinsons-the-ministry-for-the-future/)*)  
This story is largely a collection of fictional eye witness accounts of activities around the world related to climate change.  While there is a material focus on individuals and teams at the Ministry of the Future, Robinson weaves in climate refugees, scientists in Antarctica, a range of workers and leaders in India, super-rich in Davos, carbon...  And *second hand* reports of climate-related news from around the globe.  The story incorporates a wide range of ideas and activities that humans employ to resist climate catastrophe and to begin *healing* earth's ecosystems.  
Robinson has a LOT of faith in technology and in our ability to evolve it to meet challenges presented by climate change and human responses to it. Some seem like a great fit -- an inspiration. But not all. He seems to believe some of, maybe most of the arguments in favor of replacing existing currencies across the globe with digital currencies tightly coupled to blockchain technology -- I think he says primarily that this approach will be safer, more transparent, and more democratic.  In context, this appears to ignore the energy consumption (*its contributions to climate catastrophe*), operating expenses, and latency confronted when applied at global scale.  Sure, there are organizations trading some of the risk management provided by *difficult* (energy hungry) proof-of-work calculations for a reduction in transaction fees, infrastructure and operations expenses, but it is not clear where Robinson intends his characters go for *safe*, climate-friendly currency.

At the annual autumn ball at Swampshire's Stabmort Park, a murder (*and then another*), and Beatrice springs into action to find the killer...

By [Ray Nayler](https://www.raynayler.net/bio-and-bibliography.html)  ( – )  

Reading Notes: In addition to this story being about discovering intelligent (*non-human*) beings with their own language and culture, it is also about our world transformed by AI (*of varying levels of sophistication*) creeping into most industries across the globe, and some of the risks associated with extreme concentration of economic and technological power.  Along the way Ray Nayler explores ways that individuals relate to each other, and the influence of power (*broadly defined*) in human relations. What is consciousness?  What makes a given human valuable?  How could we identify a complex, symbolic system of communication in an *alien* species? Technology always results in unintended consequences, "a creature emerging out of our need to invent..." And much, much more.

[Overdrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/8557446/the-mountain-in-the-sea):  
Humankind discovers intelligent life in an octopus species with its own language and culture, and sets off a high-stakes global competition to dominate the future.  The transnational tech corporation DIANIMA has sealed off the remote Con Dao Archipelago, where a species of octopus has been discovered that may have developed its own language and culture. The marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen, who has spent her life researching cephalopod intelligence, will do anything for the chance to study them. She travels to the islands to join DIANIMA's team: a battle-scarred securityagent and the world's first (and possibly last) android.  The octopuses hold the key to unprecedented breakthroughs in extrahuman intelligence. As Dr. Nguyen struggles to communicate with the newly discovered species, forces larger than DIANIMA close in to seize the octopuses for themselves.But no one has yet asked the octopuses what they think. Or what they might do about it.  A near-future thriller, a meditation on the nature of consciousness, and an ecological call to arms, Ray Nayler's dazzling literary debut The Mountain in the Sea is a mind-blowing dive into the treasure and wreckage of humankind's legacy.

In a corporate-dominated spacefaring future, planetary missions must be approved and supplied by the Company. Exploratory teams are accompanied by Company-supplied security androids, for their own safety. But in a society where contracts are awarded to the lowest bidder, safety isn't a primary concern. On a distant planet, a team of scientists are conducting surface tests, shadowed by their Company-supplied 'droid - a self-aware SecUnit that has hacked its own governor module, and refers to itself (though never out loud) as "Murderbot." Scornful of humans, all it really wants is to be left alone long enough to figure out who it is. But when a neighboring mission goes dark, it's up to the scientists and their Murderbot to get to the truth.

>The follow-up to the hugely popular science fiction action-adventure All Systems Red, Artificial Condition continues The Murderbot Diaries, a science fiction series that tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. It appeals to fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or Iain M. Banks' Culture novels. The main character is a deadly security droid that has bucked its restrictive programming and is balanced between contemplative self-discovery and an idle instinct to kill all humans. "As a heartless killing machine, I was a complete failure." It has a dark past-one in which a number of humans were killed. A past that caused it to christen itself "Murderbot." But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more. Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don't want to know what the "A" stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue. What it discovers will forever change the way it thinks.

I was in college at the time and understood that its content was important, and kept that little booklet -- reading it again from time to time.  It was written in a time still colored by what Norman called "the Arab oil embargo" and its demonstration of how fragile were the industrial world's petroleum-based economies.  Part of his argument was that humanity needed to implement major energy conservation and to invent/implement new energy generation & transmission technologies to avoid a predicted carbon dioxide-induced global warming catastrophy.  On page 31 Mr. Norman began an explanation of the growing concern "that carbon dioxode -- an inevitable by-product of burning fossil fuels -- is building up in the atmosphere and acting rather like a greenhouse, preventing a fraction of the earth's heat from being radiated into space."  He went on, "The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is already (*as he wrote those words in 1978!*) believed to have risen by about 13 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and it may double over the next 50 years.  Such a change could increase the average temperatures on the earth's surface by 2-3 degrees C." He then summarized the predicted impacts "In general, global warming would bring increased rainfall and probably cause local weather patterns to become more variable."  And then:  
>A more worrying possibility is that global warming could have an adverse impact on the stability of the polar ice caps. ...(*and*) over the next 50 years could raise polar temperatures by an amount sufficient to cause the West Antarctic ice sheet to break up.  Such an event would raise the average sea level by about five meters, which would be catastrophic for many low-lying areas.  

Here we are (*I read this book -- "[NY 2140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140)" -- in October 2023, more than 40 years after reading Colin Norman's warning*) and this [Kim Stanley Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson) novel is about how ignoring too much of that global warming / climate change message played out for the world by following a diverse set of New Yorkers in the early years of the 2140s.  Sea level rise had created canals of NY streets, and islands of skyscrapers.  In this novel Robinson argues that capitalism and global finance were key culprits in ignoring/rejecting global warming / climate change for so long that global catastrophy was guaranteed, and for increasing the scope of suffering after catastrophies arive...  Ultimately, he delivers a hopeful conclusion -- with small-d democracy having a foundational role.  
There has been [some criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140#Scientific_accuracy) about Robinson's science and/or politics.  My advice is to remember that this is a novel and telling a relevant story doesn't mean **doing** hard or soft science, nor does it require avoiding any political point of view.

By [Valentine Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine_Williams)  (1883 – 1946)  

Reading Notes: This is another WWI British spy novel that screams its age and culture. The dialog is wooden and formulaic throughout. This genera is an acquired taste... Some of the key characters include:  
  * Arthur Mackwayte, dies early in the story...  
  * Barbara Mackwayte, daughter of Arthur Mackwayte and the Secret Service Chief's secretary.  
  * Maurice Strangwise, Captain -- *Who is he really?* “Captain Strangwise has escaped from a prisoners’ of war camp in Germany, Major,” he said, “we’ve been trying to get hold of him for days! He’s the talk of London!” ..."I got rather struck on the lady (*Nur-el-Din*) when she was touring in Canada some years ago, and in fact I spent so much more money than I could afford on her that I had to discontinue the acquaintance. Then I met her here when I got away from Germany a month ago; she was lonely, so I took her about a bit. Okewood, I’m afraid I was rather indiscreet."  
  * Desmond Okewood, Brigade Major as gunner officer with Anglo-Irish parentage. The Secret Service arranged to have him 'killed in action' so he can *become*/impersonate Basil Bellward/Wolfgang Bruhl and hunt for German spies along with other targets of the British Secret Service.  
  * Desmond's brother Francis Okewood. "...serving on a German Staff somewhere at the back of Jerusalem the Golden."  
  * Nur-el-Din, spying for the Germans (*...along with her maid, a trim Frenchwoman, Nur-el-Din’s business manager 'Lazarro, alias Sacchetti alias Le Tardenois,' a fat, voluble Italian, Nur-el-Din's secretary, an olive-skinned South American youth in an evening coat with velvet collar, and Nur-el-Din's principal male dancer in a scanty Egyptian dress with grotesquely painted face.*)  
  * Retired English business man, alias Basil Bellward, is a German spy named Wolfgang Bruhl.

Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/143949/on-writing  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/13779/on-writing  
By [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King)  (1947 – )  

Reading Notes:  If you enjoy learning what creative people think about their art and craft, this is an excellent book -- the kind that after listening to it you find yourself searching out the book to read at your own pace, taking notes along the way.  If you just enjoy learning about people, this also seems like a good fit.  Give it a listen.  In addition to enjoying the content, King's reading style and pacing was an added joy.  The [OverDrive version](https://www.overdrive.com/media/143949/on-writing) is the twentieth-anniversary audio edition that includes some additional content, so don't just stop listening at the end of the book...  
I am not a reader of Stephen King's fiction because every time I tried (*in the 1980s and 1990s*) it cost me too many sleepless nights and too much discomfort about __ (*the scary everyday scene most recently seeded into my imagination*) __.  Unlike any other author I have read, his writing has a near perfect fit for whatever part of my brain generates/remembers/emits fear in its many forms and life seems too short to give up the volume of energy required to deal with that long-lived response.  After listening to him read this book I may again try to find some fiction of his that my psyche and my day-to-day living can tolerate.

eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/3470427/the-one  
By [John Marrs](https://www.johnmarrsauthor.com/marriage-act)  ( – )  

Reading Notes: The storyline is built around a new service "Match Your DNA" that uses a variations in a newly discovered gene that are the same (*they match*) in only two people in the world. A *matched* pair of individuals are supposed to be biologically *perfect* for each other -- "A DNA swab could find your soulmate."  Using a small number of couples, the author goes on to explore some ethical dilemmas and questions about morality that might be associated with the operation of a service like Match Your DNA and with the way their customers use the information it discloses.  Core/lead characters include: Ellie (scientist/CEO of Match Your DNA), Mandy (*drifting* divorcee),  Christopher (psychopath), Nick (engaged to the *love of his life*), and Jade (*matched* with a man on the other side of the globe).  
In general, this was an OK book for me.  A few of the threads about customer-couples were *good reading.*  But after working in the information security arena for decades, the author's depiction of a hacker and what an individual hacker might accomplish in the context of a complex global corporation's IT and security infrastructures seemed so *wrong* that it was just a *stinker* for me (*others, who don't carry that career baggage, may feel very differently about that part of the book*).

By [Nick Seabrook](https://nickseabrook.domains.unf.edu/about/)  ( – )  

Reading Notes: A key message of this book: *When they choose to do so politicians in power generally get to pick the voters they want...an historically effective effort to put a thumb on the scale of elections and to diminish democracy.*  I thought that I knew quite a bit about the topic, but this interesting history of [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) showed me I was broadly ignorant about how this *tool* has been used [in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States) since at least the 18th century and elsewhere before that, as well as how the U.S. Supreme Court has been unable/unwilling to deal with it in any democracy-supporting way.  Today, gerrymandering is used across the U.S. to keep Republicans in office even though they get millions fewer votes than their election opponents.  This book provides some useful and entertaining context for the nature and implementations of that practice.  It ends with recommendations and with a plea for all of us to fight for effective democracy -- in part by getting into the district mapping details: processes, intent(s), implementation(s), and outcomes.

By [Edwin L. Sabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_L._Sabin) (1870 - 1952)  Published 1917  

Reading Summary: Like a number of E.L.Sabin's works, this is *historical-fiction-for-young-readers*, and is a sweeping overview, without a lot of **exploration** detail.  It is primarily a light, shallow drama focused on a small subset of the Lewis & Clark team...  The presentation is an assembly of numerous readers, which may not bring joy to every listener.  That said, it is an entertaining story that moves along throughout.  NOTE: There are issues of race in this story-telling, particularly Native American and Black stereotypes and derogatory terms.  

Librivox Summary:  
>One of the significant and astounding explorations, in 1804-1806, was the expedition under the leadership of Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William Clark opening up a trail from St. Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Coast at the mouth of the mighty Columbia River. Edwin Sabin write an engaging account of this challenging journey with ample dialogue so that it reads like an adventure story rather than just a history full of facts and figures, but he fairly represents the characters and events of the long expedition.

>In "Our Changing Constitution," Charles W. Pierson delves into the intricate evolution of the United States Constitution amidst changing societal norms. Through a combination of legal analysis and historical context, Pierson explores how amendments and judicial interpretations have shaped the Constitution to adapt to modern challenges.

Pierson's clear and concise writing style makes complex legal concepts accessible to readers, creating an informative and thought-provoking narrative. This book provides a comprehensive overview of the dynamic nature of constitutional law and the ongoing relevance of the Constitution in today's society. Drawing on his background as a constitutional law expert, Charles W. Pierson brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to his analysis of the evolving Constitution. His expertise in legal theory and historical precedent informs the book's insightful commentary on the interpretations and applications of constitutional principles. Pierson's passion for constitutional law shines through in his writing, making "Our Changing Constitution" a compelling and enlightening read. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the complexities of constitutional law and its impact on contemporary legal issues.

### Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning  (10:42)  
https://librivox.org/pagan-christian-creeds-their-origin-and-meaning-by-edward-carpenter/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561  
By [Edward Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carpenter) (1844 - 1929)  published 1921  

Reading Notes:  This book is a bit of a slog and includes quite a bit of repetition.  Carpenter identifies common "religious" language and practices across time and across cultures.  He argues that Christianity is a recent iteration of an "ancient world-religion."  "In the case of Christianity the historical period has lasted nearly 2,000 years, and, as I say, we can hardly expect or wish that it should last much longer."  He sees a deterministic evolution of humanity -- whose psychological development necessitates the emergence of a new phase where "religion" will re-incorporate the natural world, including all communities of human beings (*as opposed to the current 'individualistic' phase*).  His arguements seemed to suggest that the insane waste represented WWI signaled the end of the current phase and announced the coming of the next.  
QUOTE:  
>"The whole futile and idiotic structure of commerce and industry in which we are now imprisoned springs from that falsehood of individualistic self-seeking which marks the second stage of human evolution. That stage is already tottering to its fall, destroyed by the very flood of egotistic passions and interests, of vanities, greeds, and cruelties, all warring with each other, which are the sure outcome and culmination of its operation. With the restoration of the sentiment of the Common Life, and the gradual growth of a mental attitude corresponding, there will emerge from the flood something like a solid earth--something on which it will be possible to build with good hope for the future. Schemes of reconstruction are well enough in their way, but if there is no ground of REAL HUMAN SOLIDARITY beneath, of what avail are they?"  

Summary from Librivox:  
>In this work from 1921, Carpenter analyzes the origin of Christian beliefs, arguing that they are derived from pre-Christian myths and religions, rather than being new revelations to the human race. He believes that "psychologically man has evolved from simple consciousness to self-consciousness, and is now in process of evolution towards another and more extended kind of consciousness," anticipating a post-Christian era. In the penultimate chapter, "The Exodus of Christianity," he sets out his belief that for Christianity "to hold the field of Religion in the Western World is neither probable nor desirable." Chapters such as "Solar Myths and Christian Festivals," "Rites of Expiation and Redemption," and "The Saviour-God and the Virgin-Mother" analyze his tenet as seen in different contexts.

### A Political Pilgrim in Europe  (9:34)  
https://librivox.org/a-political-pilgrim-in-europe-by-mrs-philip-snowden/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/68238/  
By [Ethel Snowden, Viscountess Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Snowden) (1881 - 1951)  published 1921  

Reading Notes:  Snowden invests quite a bit of time in describing or just mentioning by name individuals she met or just saw in her travels.  Not being sufficiently well read on this period, I assume that I was unable to draw some of the context that these mentions may have for others (*my being unwilling to research each one of these personalities*).  That said, her descriptions of what she saw and heard of conditions around Europe in the years following WWI provide some depth and color missing from many formal WWI *Histories*.  Snowden also appears to incorporate a heavy load of 19th century wealthy-ruling-class culture -- which, I think, should be considered when reading or listening to her observations and analysis.  It is difficult to understand her noted *pacifism* with her acceptance of (*almost justification of*) the socialist/communist terrorism engulfing Russia at the time.  Snowden's analysis of and hopes for Communist Russia during these murderous years support Galeazzi's summary below  -- that "Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure."  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Written in the aftermath of Word War I, Viscountess Snowden recounts her travels in post war Europe in, as she describes it, "an attempt to do what one person might do, or at least attempt, to restore good feeling between the nations and the normal course of life as quickly as possible." An outspoken pacifist, socialist, and feminist who nonetheless strongly denounced the Bolsheviks, Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure. whose views and observations offer a unique perspective on Europe in the '20s.

Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages?"  
  "In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow. Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom."

### The Prefect. (20:00)

Ebook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/613444/the-prefect  
By [Alastair Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds)  (1966 -  )  

Reader Notes: This is book 7 in the [Revelation Series](https://www.overdrive.com/series/revelation-space), but my first exposure to this collection.  It stands-alone well and I didn't have the urge to stop and read the prior volumes.  It is, in part, a story about a set of highly *small-d* democratic, yet diverse utopian societies 400 years in the future (?) being attacked for the stated purpose of imposing a strict authoritarian *government* (*or simply, as has happened with authoritarian leaders throughout history, taking over simply for their personal security, pleasure and longevity*).  It has been [described as](https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780441015917) "hybrid of [space opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera), [police procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_procedural) and [character study](https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/38272/what-exactly-is-a-character-study)," and I agree.  The story follows Tom Dreyfus, law enforcement officer as he is repeatedly confronted with challenges to his sense of commitment to the rule of law, to the democracy he is sworn to protect, and to his relationships with peers in law enforcement.  There is a lot more to this story, but it is worth reading/listening to simply for the inner and outer dialog of officer Tom Dreyfus.  This is also science fiction and includes industrial human slaughter in an environment composed of an interesting range of future space habitats, modes of computing, medicine, communication, of transportation and much more.  

Publisher Summary:  
>Tom Dreyfus is a Prefect, a law enforcement officer with the Panoply. His beat is the multifaceted utopian society of the Glitter Band, that vast swirl of space habitats orbiting the planet Yellowstone, the teeming hub of a human interstellar empire spanning many worlds. His current case: investigating a murderous attack against one of the habitats that left 900 people dead, a crime that appalls even a hardened cop like Dreyfus. But then his investigation uncovers something far more serious than mass slaughter -- a covert plot by an enigmatic entity who seeks nothing less than total control of the Glitter Band. Before long, the Panoply detectives are fighting against something worse than tyranny, in a struggle that will lead to more devastation and more death. And Dreyfus will discover that to save what is precious, you may have to destroy it.

### Preferred Risk (06:26)  
https://librivox.org/preferred-risk-by-frederik-pohl/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51814  
By [Frederik Pohl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Pohl) (1919 - 2013) and [Lester del Rey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_del_Rey) (1915 - 1993)  Published 1955  

Reading Notes: This is another story expressing a thread of post-WWII "*atomic bomb-crazed*" America (*even though most of the action takes place in Italy*).  World leaders -- Insurance company executives -- are crude and violent liers, attempting to profit from *governing*.  Ethical simpleton Claims Adjuster Wills starts a new job in Naples, Italy, and sees just enough of the truth to set him on a quest for justice...  NOTE: There are issues of race/ethnicity in "Preferred Risk", particularly Italian stereotypes and derogatory terms.  

Librivox Summary:  
>The Company insures you against everything. Everything except war, that is. But they've put an end to wars (or so they claim). The Company also controls everything. Including all the sources of weapons. The Company is dedicated to the happiness of mankind (or so they claim). Medical Treatment and Law Enforcement are just a few of the other services they provide to the entire world. Claims Adjuster Wills was a happy Company employee until his path crossed those of a man with no legs and a mysterious woman. All of a sudden, his world was turned upside down, and his decisions could determine the future of the planet. This collaborative work was originally published under the pseudonym Edson McCann. It was the winner of the 1955 Galaxy-Simon & Schuster novel contest. [Summary by Nick Bulka](https://librivox.org/preferred-risk-by-frederik-pohl/)

Reader's Notes:  
This is entertaining "*junk fiction*."  There are numerous absurd plot threads and many *tense* situations where dialog is almost comic...  Once given plot-lines were established, a lot of *often* predictable action and dialog followed.  That said, I think that it is useful long-distance driving background audio.

>"The President Is Missing confronts a threat so huge that it jeopardizes not just Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street, but all of America. Uncertainty and fear grip the nation. There are whispers of cyberterror and espionage and a traitor in the Cabinet. Even the President himself becomes a suspect, and then he disappears from public view...  Set over the course of three days, The President Is Missing sheds a stunning light upon the inner workings and vulnerabilities of our nation.  Filled with information that only a former Commander-in-Chief could know, this is the most authentic, terrifying novel to come along in many years. And a timely, historic story that will be read–and talked about–for years to come."

Reader's Notes: This book is an extension of the [Tom Clancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy) [Jack Ryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ryan_(character)) [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ryan_(franchise)).

An *ageless* [John Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clark_(Ryanverse_character)) shadows them -- just in case. Concurrently, Dan Murray is leading a search for a spy who appears to have stolen secrets from a top secret F117 aircraft crash site in the Nevada desert. The details in this story do a good job describing the world of 1985 (*clothes, phones, cars, planes, the 1980s chapter of the Cold War, some symptoms of Reagan's anti-Soviet extremism, the general level of terrorist and government-initiated violence across the globe, and how complicated were relations along the European East/West border*).

Text: https://archive.org/details/SaintJoan/page/n1  
By [George Bernard Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw) (1856 - 1950)  

Reading Notes:  If you have even a microscopic interest in 'Saint Joan' or Middle Ages France, this seems like an excellent little book (*maybe just an essay*).  It assumes that the reader understands some about mid-20th century Brittan and New York, but is still a pleasure in relative ignorance of both.  The reading by David Wales is a perfect match.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Saint Joan is a play by George Bernard Shaw about 15th-century French military figure Joan of Arc. Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play reflects Shaw's belief that the people involved in Joan's trial acted according to what they thought was right. He wrote in his preface to the play: “There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.” (Wikipedia) Modern British author, critic, poet, and broadcaster Clive James, commenting on a book that changed his mind, wrote: “George Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.” (The Guardian, 5 October 2019) [Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales](https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/)

Reading Notes: This mid-20th century book's main story-line is about colonization and genetics after faster-than-light travel was available to humankind.  While the author's intent was satire, the characters remain *one-dimensional*, predictable, shallow and all *surface* (*could that be the point?*).  I believe that this book may only be entertaining to those who like U.S. 1950's "*mass market*" science fiction.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Ross was a junior trader on Halsey's Planet, and had great prospects but was not happy at all. Everything smelled of decay. The whole planet seemed to be slowly disappearing, the population dwindling month by month and year by year and yet no one seemd to care or even notice. Something was very, very wrong. When the first interstellar transport in 30 years arrived on Halsey's Planet, it brought things to a head. The ship had touched on six other colony worlds - and all six had been devoid of human life. Where was everybody? It was almost as if humankind, when separated by cosmic distances from Mother Earth, could not survive. He didn't know the answer but he knew it all smelled highly of decay. Decay and Rot. This highly praised novel by C.M.Kornbluth and Frederick Pohl was first published in 1954 was seen as a wonderful satire on various trends in the society of the 1950's.

<details><summary>The shipwreck. By William Falconer.  1762 </summary>

### The shipwreck.  1762  
Audio of 1858 version: https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/

By [William Falconer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Falconer_(poet)) (1732-1769)  

Reading Notes:  
The interesting biography of William Falconer was more enjoyable than the extensive poem.  The style and some content of the poetry may turn some off, but it includes some excellent rhymes (*think song lyrics*).  

>"William Falconer's "The Shipwreck" recounts the final voyage of the merchant ship Britannia and her crew.  See the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) summary at: https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/library-archive/shipwreck-william-falconer  

>[RMG Digital Resources Librarian 'Renee' says](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/william-falconers-shipwreck): "Part fiction, part autobiography and part instructional guide for sailors, William Falconer's poem The Shipwreck is a must-read for Patrick O'Brian fans. Fair enough, there's no Jack Aubrey character - but the combination of high seas drama and technical detail makes for a surprisingly compelling read."  

>Librivox Summary: A semi-autobiographical poem in three cantos recounts the wreck of the merchant ship Britannia. Written by William Falconer, a seaman of some experience, who survived one shipwreck himself with only two others of the 50 man crew and eventually perished in the loss of a second ship, the frigate Aurora, 20 years later. The poem is recognized for its realistic portrayal of life aboard an 18th century sailing vessel. [Summary by Fritz](https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/)

Reader's Notes:  
Unfortunately, the reader's performance in this recording was unique in a way that was almost *repulsive* to me (*it may not be so to you*)...  I listened to more than 10% of the book before giving up.  I may read the text.  

Librivox Summary:  
>"Set against a backdrop of Prohibition-era New York, The Small Bachelor is the story of a young man from the West who is trying to be an artist, an older man from the East who wants to be a Westerner, his daughter who does not want to marry an English lord, her stepmother who wants her to, a policeman who wants to become a poet, a writer of pamphlets who says he “can make a poet out of two sticks and a piece of orange peel” if they follow his instructions carefully, and a young woman from the West who has become a fortune-teller. There are also several other characters with other motives, and a number of coincidences which bring them all together in various constellations of absurdity which depict the human condition at its finest."

eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/1638062/station-eleven  
By [Emily St. John Mandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_St._John_Mandel)  (1979 – )  

Reading Notes: As I write this, the global COVID-19 pandemic started only four and a half years ago in early 2020. I assume that Emily St. John  Mandel wrote this story in the years leading up to its 2014 publish date. That context made it hard for me to resist hearing this story as something humanity just very narrowly dodged...    
This novel explores how a range of creative, empathetic people choose to live after surviving an *end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it* pandemic. Not everyone chose that path, which sets up threads of conflict that help drive this excellent story forward. The author introduces a number of characters by exploring their *before-time* and how their lives intersect and influence each other and some of those around them. The main characters are written as "*humans*" -- surrounded by some less fleshed-out charactures -- in a way that drew me into their stories and into the novel that brought them together. The *mechanics* of that writing/story telling stood out as a member of a small, expertly executed category that I don't often have the opportunity to read.  See the reviews below for more thorough summaries and analyses of this book.  

[Overdrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/1499830/station-eleven):  
>Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.  Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.

I can remember nodding in agreement (*without a clear understanding of the context of those assumed truisms*)...  Mike Duncan describes Roman activities in the previous century that add a lot of context and help build out some understanding of the culture and personalities that *led to* that day in the Roman Senate when [Marcus Junius Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Junius_Brutus) (*and others'*) assassinate Julius Caesar.

By [Joseph Jacobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Jacobs) (1854 - 1916)  

Reader Notes:  
I enjoyed this summary of a "*typical*" Western understanding of how the world was "*discovered*" (up to the mid-1890s).  It aligns with much of what I was taught in high school and college, though it is no longer the narrative I would attach to these discoveries and conquests.  
Some might be turned off by how the author ignores oppression built around the concepts of race, caste, and class throughout his descriptions of how Europeans claimed lands across the globe.  I believe they are expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of the readers he targeted at the time.  He makes no attempt to deal with negative outcomes of colonization.  Not only were land and resources stolen in the colonization process but colonization was both a cultural and literal genocide -- ignoring the value of indigenous peoples.  The impacts of colonization continue through today.  This book may be hurtful to some.  
[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/the-story-of-geographical-discovery-how-the-world-became-known-by-joseph-jacobs/):  
>"This book was first published in 1897. It's a short work, but it encompasses a vast subject—nothing less than determining the detailed geographical plan of our entire world! In the process, Jacobs feeds us dates and names and events and places and maps in a dense stream. It's a bit like drinking from a fire hose, but see it through, and the reader (or listener) will acquire a surprisingly complete overview of world history as well as geography. It's well worth absorbing, even by those not so geographically inclined, if only as a source for winning endless bar bets. Beginning in ancient times, the author identifies three main forces that have contributed to our present understanding: wars of conquest, competition for trade, and (eventually) pure scientific curiosity. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, early Greeks, Babylonians, and many other Mediterranean peoples contributed, often unwillingly, the streams of knowledge that Ptolemy of Alexandria summed up in the great Ptolemaei Orbis (ca.150 AD), the first “real” map of the whole known world. The evolution of world maps to incorporate (and sometime conceal) new discoveries is a key theme of this fascinating work."

Reader's Notes:  See the [Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_Also_Rises).  
NOTE: There are issues of race and religion in the telling of "The Sun Also Rises", particularly where the author uses derogatory and dehumanizing language in the description of a Black boxer and a character of the Jewish faith. It is LibriVox's policy to record texts as written.  

Librivox Summary:  
>The Sun Also Rises (1926) was Hemingway's first novel to be published, though there is his novella The Torrents of Spring which was published earlier in the same year. The novel describes, expressed through the voice of Jake Barnes, a short period of social life that ranges from Paris to locations in Spain. One might say that the action occurs in Pamplona, Spain with the annual festival of San Fermin and its running of bulls and subsequent days of bullfights, but one can easily argue that the real interest of the novel is in its portrayal of the group to which Barnes is a part and how he details their anxieties, frailties, hopes, and frustrations.

The novel follows Lale Sokolov, a 26 year old Slovakian Jew sent to [Auschwitz-Birkenau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz-Birkenau) in 1942.  His language skills led to being assigned tatowierer (*the German word for tattooist*) at the prison, and he tattooed the arms of thousands of Nazi prisoners.  He met 17 year old Gita Furman at Auschwitz and this is their story as viewed through Lale.  It is also a story about [the holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust).

### Termination Shock. (23:00) (720 pages)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6270840/termination-shock  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/6071337/termination-shock  
By [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson) (1959 - _)  

Reading Notes: We should all read this book.  It is not Kim Stanley Robinson's *World Government*/*World Management* approach to (*finally*) dealing with the effects and causes of climate change.  Neal Stephenson builds a near-future world where entrepreneur's and *the super rich* act before governments find the will to do so. That results in governments acting in their sometimes immediate and sometimes strategic interests spanning a continuum from active cooperation to pointed overwhelming violence (central actors in that thread are China and India). From [stick-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick-fighting) (*more specifically, [Gatka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatka)*) in the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas) (see: [LAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Actual_Control)), to geoengineering projects in West Texas, the Mediterranean and New Guinea, to tsunami attacks on the Netherlands and Great Britian, Stephenson knits an engaging story that develops characters, science & technology, top tier political action and one path to climate action.  

Some characters:  Frederika Mathilde Louisa Saskia (Queen of the Netherlands), Rufus "Red" Grant (ex-soldier, Black-White-Mexican-Osage-Comanche), T.R. Schmidt/"McHooligan" (Texas billionaire), Deep "Laks" Singh (young [Punjabi Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabi_Canadians) [Sikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh)),

By [Annalee Newitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalee_Newitz)  

Reader Notes: "Set 60,000 years in the future, The Terraformers traces the development of a [terraformed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraformed) planet over the course of 1,000 years." (*from the [Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terraformers)*)  A lot of ideas in this book are interesting in the abstract, for example: investors taking on projects like terraforming with timelines in the thousands of years, "lab grown" lifeforms that are based on licensed genetic templates -- including human-like life forms -- many of which tightly integrate a range of sensor and communications technologies, "mixing" the characteristics of multiple life forms to achieve both highly specialized and highly generalized beings, corporations "building" populations of "lab grown" to employ as formal, legal slaves.  That said, the performance of this audio book seemed to crowd out too much of that content for me -- so much so that is was a difficult slog to get through to the end.  The performance choices may have seemed bold or innovative to some involved in its production, but it amounted to a material turn-off to me.  The arc of the story also seemed heavily built around warn & simplistic ideas like capitalism==corruption, wealth==immorality...

Reading Notes: This story is told as a [nonlinear narrative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_narrative). In that context, it's central character is Ye Wenjie, an astrophysics graduate who saw her father get beaten to death during the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) (1966-1976) and she was also identified as a traitor, sent to a labor camp and later sentenced to prison. Because of her training and the content of a paper she published while attending university, she was recruited to participate in a secret Chinese military project involving high powered radio transmissions and monitoring.  Then it gets both interesting and confusing (*see the [Wikipedia summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) if you want to know more*...)

https://librivox.org/the-torrents-of-spring-by-ernest-hemingway/  
Text: https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20210135  
By [Ernest Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway)  (1899 - 1961)  
Reader's Notes: This is an excellent tale read by an excellent performer.  
Although this book incorporates humor throughout, it was not a *happy* read for me.  It is about a tough time in a tough (*Northwest Michigan*) place and the author expresses his (*or the character's*) energetic prejudices in story-lines that include a Black man and Native Americans.  This story may be hurtful to some readers.  

Librivox Summary:  
>The Torrents of Spring was Hemingway's second novel to be published. It would not be wrong to say that it is unique among the author's work as it is a clear parody of Sherwood Anderson's Dark Laughter and full of absurdist humor. Were Hemingway's name not attached to it, one might wonder who actually wrote the novel. The work is a product of its time and the reader is cautioned that there are uncomfortable portrayals of both a Black man and Native Americans. In truth, no one is treated in a sensitive way.

### Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series (10:31)  
https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706  
By [E. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith) (1890 - 1965)  published 1948  

Reading Notes: Published in 1948 and 1950, the Triplanetary and First Lensman books express a fantastic post-WWII U.S.A. optimism about technology, all things "the Atom," and the supremacy of North American military power.  
The characters that drive the story forward are white male North Americans.  
The lensmen engage in massive death & destruction in their quest for "increasing the general happiness of all humanity" (*a seeming contradiction they don't acknowlege*).  
The most evil characters are leaders and their followers in North American Nationalist politics -- in league with organized crime.  When these politicians & other criminals are caught, they use features of the existing legal system as weapons and delay, delay, delay (*sound like a 'real life' former Present and his lackies?*). A core theme seems to be a battle between the "uncorruptable" (*democrats*) and the "corrupt" (*athoritarians*) -- with "civilization" owing everything to the "uncorruptable."  
There are also minor characters from many other planets and galacies.  

Summary:  
>Triplanetary was first serialized in Amazing Stories in 1934. After the [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series) became popular, Smith took his Triplanetary story and turned it into the first of the Lensman series, using it as a prequel to give the back story for the protaganists in the Lensmen series. He added 6 new chapters, doubling it in size and it's really a different book from the serialized novel, being published 14 years after the first. It was put into Gutenberg just last year.  
>The novel covers several episodes in an eons-long eugenics project of the super-intelligences of the Arisia. This alien race is breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their arch enemy, the Eddore. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's (Gharlane of Eddore) reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two and Three. The final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster than light travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, two very important members of the eugenics project, are introduced. They will play the leading roles in the next story, First Lensman.

>The earth is undefended. A ripe, juicy, rich plum just innocently waiting for one of the many new and warlike civilizations in the nearby universe to reach down and pluck to plunder and rape. Well... undefended can mean many things. In this case, humans have colonized many worlds and found many surprisingly human like races among the stars. But when these human colonies are threatened and even viciously attacked by really alien civilizations, earth does nothing to help them. Earth, fat, rich earth sits back and lets her own colonies be practically wiped out, claiming a neutrality that seems a thin veil for cowardice and deceit. How this happens and the story behind the story is what this exciting story is all about. ([Summary by phil chenevert](https://librivox.org/victory-by-lester-del-rey-2/))

By [Rob Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Hart_(author)) and [https://robwhart.com/](https://robwhart.com/)  (1982 – )  

Reading Notes: Set in the near future, Hart's "Cloud" company seems loosely constructed on the *real life* Amazon constellation of corporations.  The author constructed *Cloud* founder using some of history's most dehumanizing authoritarian ideas and tendencies.  Bent on organizing his businesses around right wing social and economic freedom for the ultra-wealthy and evil assumptions about planned *communities*, managerial hierarchy, humans as just another corporate *consumable*, building corporate systems and measures to optimize profit at the expense of worker health and dignity the Cloud founder markets himself as a beneficient force for good.  The story is centered around corporate spy-for-hire "Zinnia" and struggling worker Paxton, who is a new member of the *Cloud* security staff.  This a dark suspense novel about a chain of privately built communities-for-profit -- citizens be damned...  Some reviews suggest this story is a satire, but after a long career in Corporate America, the author seemed to me to be writing about categories and tactics of management employed throughout large-scale tech-centric organizations *in real life* for years already (*with the exception of some extreme Federal legislation that the Cloud founder was able to get passed... IRL corporate titans have not yet achieved the level of freedom-to-be-evil described in this book, but not for want of trying*).  At a key point in the novel, the Cloud founder describes how he employed [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) as a core component of personnel management...

Each had the ability to *hear* the nature around them in ways unknown to the rest of us.  In a way that remains undisclosed, they also had some ability to communicate *need* or *instruction* to parts of that natural world (*some insects and crows are described in the book*) in ways that were sometimes refered to as *witchcraft* by the society that surrounded them.  It was an interesting story that seemed a little like a proposal for a movie.

By [Henry Duff Traill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Duff_Traill) (1842 - 1900)  

Reader's Notes: This seems like a well-researched (*for 1888*) biography of William III (AKA William of Orange, 1650-1702) and (*with excellent reading*) it was an enjoyable experience.  

Librivox Summary:  
>William Henry, Prince of Orange and Nassau, Dutch William to the English, was born in a state threatened by the military ambitions of Louis XIV. “Reared from his very cradle amid the animosities of contending factions,” Traill writes, “the young Prince learned early those four lessons of statecraft,—to conceal his designs, to watch his opportunities, to choose his instruments, and to bide his time.” The Dutch Republic, distrustful of monarchs, reluctantly chose him as stadtholder to lead their armies, and then, after the overthrow of James II in 1688, he became with his consort, Mary, England’s king.

By [Ruth Ware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Ware)  (1977 – )  

Reading Notes: Laura "Lo" Blacklock, who works for a travel journal is assigned to cover the maiden voyage of exclusive luxury *cruise ship* (yaht) for hopping the Scandinavian coastline, Aurora Borealis, to named and unnamed Norwegian fjords.  Days before her departure, Lo, debilitated by a (*another*) drinking binge, was the target of a *professional* home break-in and then *may have* just broken up with her partner, is deeply shaken.  But this is a *plumb* gig, so she goes on the cruise.  Once at sea, she *witnesses* a woman being thrown overboard -- but discovers that all the passengers are accounted for...  This is similar to a classic "*[whodunnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whodunit)*" story -- with the detective swapped out with a travel-writer.  The book received a lot of love from major book review lists, but it was just OK for me -- maybe, again, just for me, the narrator seemed an ill fit for this text...  You may love it too.  I think that the storyline and content would work well for the "young adult" reader category.

Reader Notes: This is a [young adult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction) [science fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fantasy) novel written in the *late 1950s*.  Four kids - Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and Calvin O'Keefe jump space and time on a galacies-long quest to find and rescue the Murrys' father.  The story explores *growing up*, *being yourself*, courage, physics, spiritual life, evil and good in a way that I think works for adults as well as the 12 to 18 crowd.

Reading Notes:  

Project Gutenberg [Automated Summary](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2358):  
>"The After House" by Mary Roberts Rinehart is a mystery novel penned in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the character (Ralph) Leslie, who finds himself on a yacht named Ella shortly after recovering from a serious illness. As the narrative unfolds, readers are drawn into a web of suspense surrounding the ship and its crew, highlighting both personal ambitions and darker human emotions, culminating in a series of tragic events. At the start of the novel, Leslie introduces himself as a newly graduated medical student who, after enduring a bout of typhoid fever, is drawn to the adventurous life at sea. With a background as a deck-steward and an ambition for adventure, he is introduced to the Ella, a transformed coasting-vessel now serving as a yacht. His time on board showcases not only his interactions with the crew, including the enigmatic Miss Lee, but also hints at a brewing conflict that suggests an ominous undercurrent aboard the ship. As tensions rise, occurrences hinting at mystery and danger begin to emerge, setting the stage for a suspenseful voyage that promises intrigue and peril in equal measure.

By [Herbert Henry Gowen ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Henry_Gowen) (1864 - 1960)  

Reading Notes: Without much context (*from gaps in my education and experience*) I assume that I did not understand material portions of this history.  That said, it is a broad sweep of many events in Japanese history and should help provide context for my next exploration of the topic.  It was written in the 1920s and may not be a good fit for everyone because it incorporates some of the Western racism that -- for many -- characterized the time.

Reading Notes:  


Wikipedia Summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilers_of_the_Sea  
[Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/toilers-of-the-sea-ver2-by-victor-hugo/):  
>The book is dedicated to the island of Guernsey, where Victor Hugo spent 15 years in exile. Hugo uses the setting of a small island community to convert seemingly mundane events into drama of the highest caliber. Set just after the Napoleonic Wars, Toilers of the Sea deals with the impact of the Industrial Revolution upon the island. The story concerns a Guernseyman named Gilliatt, a social outcast who falls in love with Deruchette, the niece of a local shipowner, Mess Lethierry. When Lethierry's ship is wrecked on a perilous reef, Deruchette promises to marry whoever can salvage the ship's steam engine. Gilliatt eagerly volunteers, and the story follows his physical trials and tribulations, as well as the undeserved disapproval of his neighbors. This is a recording of the Isabel Hapgood translation, long considered the best of early translations of the work. - Summary by John Greenman.

Reading Notes: This story has been described as "viciously funny" but I found it more often a slog.  The characters were evolved, efficiently rendered caricatures, but didn't reach human status. It has a propulsive quality -- always moving the story forward -- that is comforting, and is what kept me from giving up and returning the book.

<summary>Arsenals of Folly -- The Making of the Nuclear Arms Race. By Richard Rhodes. 2007 </summary>

### Arsenals of Folly. (14:11)  
Audio: https://www.overdrive.com/media/138702/arsenals-of-folly  
eBook: https://www.overdrive.com/media/148008/arsenals-of-folly  
By [Richard Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rhodes)  (1937 – )  
886 pages (hardcover)  

Reading Notes: I lived through the period covered in this book and was reminded of the many ways individuals coveting power lied about non-existant "*secrets*" and then exaggerated *threats* to justify their actions. I think it should be required reading for anyone who finds themselves believing political or military actors who use lies and/or fear to motivate their followers and justify their actions. There is [a lot of science supporting the negative impacts of lying and dishonesty on the human brain](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+lying+does+to+the+brain&t=h_&ia=web) and this book appears to illustrate some critical outcomes when leaders (*at many levels*) make lying and exaggerating threats a habit.  At the end of the book, Rhodes argued that the the military investments driven by the repeated fake intelligence and threat inflation displaced  *trillions of dollars* in social and infrastructure investments, leaving the U.S. much worse off than it would have been.  Many of the same *characters* repeatedly appear through the Reagan, Bush *senior* and Bush (*junior*) adminstrations.  Some of them also helped create academic *research* and public and private policy organizations to nurture new generations to carry on and evolve their ideas and practices.  Their progeny remain influential today.  Richard Rhodes shares a *lot* of detail throughout this historical nonfiction book.  Unless you have an interest in Nuclear Weapons and their proliferation from the 1960s through the early 1990s this book might be a slog.  

Presentation by Rhodes on Arsenals of Folly, November 1, 2007, [C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?202128-1/arsenals-folly)  
[OverDrive Summary](https://www.overdrive.com/media/148008/arsenals-of-folly):  
>In a narrative that moves like a thriller, Rhodes sheds light on the Reagan administration’s unprecedented arms buildup in the early 1980s, as well as the arms-reduction campaign that followed, and Reagan’s famous 1986 summit meeting with Gorbachev. Rhodes’s detailed exploration of events of this time constitutes a prehistory of the neoconservatives, demonstrating that the manipulation of government and public opinion with fake intelligence and threat inflation that the administration of George W. Bush has used to justify the current “war on terror” and the disastrous invasion of Iraq were developed and applied in the Reagan era and even before.  Drawing on personal interviews with both Soviet and U.S. participants, and on a wealth of new documentation, memoir literature, and oral history that has become available only in the past ten years, Rhodes recounts what actually happened in the final years of the Cold War that led to its dramatic end. The story is new, compelling, and continually surprising -– a revelatory re-creation of a hugely important era of our recent history.

By [Asa Zadel Hall](http://www.homeoint.org/history/bio/h/hallaz.htm)  (1875 - 1965)  
297 pages.

Reading Notes: There is little good to say about this novel other than it seems to share some of the themes that made up *real life* American racism in the early 20th century.  It is not easy reading/listening and may (*for many reasons*) be hurtful to some.  

Librivox Summary:  
>In this tome the Northern narrator, Harold Edson, visits the American South with his college friend, Stanton White, in order to study first hand the social conditions of African Americans during the post-reconstruction era. Edson describes encounters with racist whites whose attacks on African Americans are vicious and unrepentant.  
>This narrative reflects primitive ideas about race that prevailed in the 19th century United States--above and below the Mason-Dixon--and a level of ignorance that, to a 21st century listener, may be difficult to fully appreciate. But in fact, many of the notions Hall visits in the text continue to echo today reminding us that race has always been a foundation upon which this country was built. ([Summary by James K. White](https://librivox.org/stanton-white-a-romance-of-the-new-south-by-asa-zadel-hall/))

By [Lionel Shriver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Shriver)  (1957 – )  

OverDrive Summary:  
>In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the "almighty dollar" plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the "bancor." In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans. "Deadbeat Nation" being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation.  
>The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies. Once the inheritance turns to ash, each family member must contend with disappointment, but also—as the U.S. economy spirals into dysfunction—the challenge of sheer survival.  
>Recently affluent, Avery is petulant that she can't buy olive oil, while her sister, Florence, absorbs strays into her cramped household. An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that's unrecognizable. Her brother, Carter, fumes at caring for their demented stepmother, now that an assisted living facility isn't affordable. Only Florence's oddball teenage son, Willing, an economics autodidact, will save this formerly august American family from the streets.  
>The Mandibles is about money. Thus it is necessarily about bitterness, rivalry, and selfishness—but also about surreal generosity, sacrifice, and transformative adaptation to changing circumstances.

Reading Notes:  

OverDrive [Summary]():  
>The accident came quickly. With no warning. In the dead of night, a precipitous plunge into a freezing river trapped everyone inside the bus. It was then that Army veteran John Reiff's life came to an end. Extinguished in the sudden rush of frigid water.  There was no expectation of survival. None. Let alone waking up beneath blinding hospital lights. Struggling to move, or see, or even breathe. But the doctors assure him that everything is normal. That things will improve. And yet, he has a strange feeling that there's something they're not telling him. As Reiff's mind and body gradually recover, he becomes certain that the doctors are lying to him. One-by-one, puzzle pieces are slowly falling into place, and he soon realizes that things are not at all what they seem. Critical information is being kept from him. Secrets. Supposedly for his own good. But who is doing this? Why? And the most important question: can he keep himself alive long enough to uncover the truth?

<summary>Is Shakespeare Dead? By Mark Twain.  1909</summary>

### Is Shakespeare Dead? (2:57)  
https://librivox.org/is-shakespeare-dead-by-mark-twain/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2431  
By [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain) (1835 - 1910)  

Wikipedia Summary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Shakespeare_Dead%3F  
Librivox Summary:  
>A short, semi-autobiographical work by American humorist Mark Twain. It explores the controversy over the authorship of the Shakespearean literary canon via satire, anecdote, and extensive quotation of contemporary authors on the subject. In the book, Twain expounds the view that Shakespeare of Stratford was not the author of the canon, and lends tentative support to the Baconian theory. The book opens with a scene from his early adulthood, where he was trained to be a steamboat pilot by an elder who often argued with him over the controversy. Twain's arguments include the following points: That little was known about Shakespeare's life, and the bulk of his biographies were based on conjecture. That a number of eminent British barristers and judges found Shakespeare's plays permeated with precise legal thought, and that the author could only have been a veteran legal professional. That in contrast, Shakespeare of Stratford had never held a legal position or office, and had only been in court over petty lawsuits late in life. That small towns lionize and celebrate their famous authors for generations, but this had not happened in Shakespeare's case. He described his own fame in Hannibal as a case in point. Twain draws parallels and analogies from the pretensions of modern religious figures and commentators on the nature of Satan. He compares the believers in Shakespeare to adherents of Arthur Orton and Mary Baker Eddy. - [Librivox Summary](https://librivox.org/is-shakespeare-dead-by-mark-twain/)

Librivox Summary:  
>Houdini, an escape artist and illusionist, became interested later in his life in debunking spiritualists, disbelieving anyone who claimed to have supernatural powers. This was during an era where paranormal phenomena, especially seances, were extremely popular. Although skeptical of their claims, he longed to find a credible source to communicate with family members he had lost. This book chronicles his travels and the many people he spoke with and his observations of their 'powers' and along the way also reveals many of the tricks they employed to deceive their paying customers.

In a small village on the coast of Northern Norway lives the Myran family. Father is a fisher man and is, in the eyes of the oldest son, like a god on the sea. Mother spends every winter in fear of losing somebody she loves to the storms and waves. She longs to move inland and turn her back on the coast and all its dangers. The novel explores some of the tension between inland and coast, poor and wealthy, tradition and progress while also depicting the highs and lows of a winter of fishing in Lofoten. - (Summary by [kathrinee](https://librivox.org/the-last-of-the-vikings-by-johan-bojer/))

Librivox Summary:

It is written with some Celtic pagan elements, but is definitely a Christian prayer asking God for protection through daily life. (2.) A Letter to the Soldiers of Coroticus - Patrick writes this letter to excommunicate the soldiers of Coroticus' army who pillaged villages in Ireland and forced many Christian converts into slavery. (3.) Confession - A short autobiography by St. Patrick who tells of being abducted into slavery and taken to Ireland, the growth of his faith, his ministry as a bishop in ordaining many priests and baptising thousands of people, and a trial where he had to defend himself against his accusers. - ([Summary by Librivox](https://librivox.org/the-collected-works-of-saint-patrick-by-saint-patrick/))

<details><summary>The Basis Of Morality.  By Arthur Schopenhauer.  1837 </summary>

### The Basis Of Morality.  (7:19)  
https://librivox.org/the-basis-of-morality-by-arthur-schopenhauer/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44929  
By [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer) (1788 - 1860)  

Reader's Notes:  

Librivox Summary:  
>In 1837, the Danish Royal Society of Sciences offered a prize to any essayist who could satisfactorily answer the question, "Is the fountain and basis of Morals to be sought for in an idea of morality which lies directly in the consciousness (or conscience), and in the analysis of the other leading ethical conceptions which arise from it? Or is it to be found in some other source of knowledge?" The Basis of Morality is the essay submitted in 1840 by German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In it, he first mercilessly deconstructs the prevailing Western theory of morality as championed by Immanuel Kant, among others, before establishing a series of maxims and thought experiments which lead him to a conclusion which points squarely at compassion as the cardinal virtue upon which all morality rests. In the appendix to this essay, he links his own conclusion with the conclusions reached millennia earlier by the authors of the Vedas and Upanishads. The essay was ultimately rejected for the prize despite being the only entry, a minor scandal with some speculation that the result was due in no small part to Schopenhauer's onslaught against Hegel—the judge of the contest being the author of a Hegelian theory of morals.

Summary from Librivox:  
>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by Vicente Blasco Ibañez and translated into English by Charlotte Brewster Jordan, depicts two branches of a family with its roots in the pampas of Argentina. The wealthy Argentinian, Julio Madariaga, comes from Spain and raises himself from poverty, becoming a self-made, wealthy cattleman. He is a man of extremes; an honest man with a rascally knack for taking advantage of others; a self-made man with overweening pride, prejudices, and a sharp, flinty temper that can spark into violence, he is at the same time given to great generosity toward those who are under him. This almost feudal lord has two daughters who marry expatriates, a Frenchman and a German.  Julio Madariaga leaves his stamp on these two families who, after his death, return to the native countries of his two sons in law. At that time, the mood of Europe is in many ways similar to that of the old gaucho, a mixture of generosity, explosive anger, romanticism, strong prejudices, and wounded pride, a mood composed of extremes painted on an oversized canvas. World War I is waiting in the wings and will leave its own stamp on the old gaucho's lineage, pitting them against each other on opposite sides in the violent first year that many think will last only a few months but will, in fact, result in improbable destruction and loss of lives. An old Russian visionary given to drink, looks out on red skies one day and experiences its coming in a vision: hoofbeats; and riders.
