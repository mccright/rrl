Reading Notes: I recommend this excellent 19th century novel to anyone who has the time to think about their place and role in the world...  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Henry James considered The Ambassadors his best, or perhaps his best-wrought, novel. It plays on the great Jamesian theme of the American abroad, who finds himself in an older, and some would say richer, culture that that of the United States, with its attractions and dangers.  Here the protagonist is Lambert Strether, a man in his fifties, editor of a small literary magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, who arrives in Europe on a mission undertaken at the urging of his patron, Mrs. Newsome, to bring back her son Chadwick.  That young man appears to be enjoying his time in Paris rather more than seems good for him, at least to those older and wiser.  The novel, however, is perhaps really about Strether's education in this new land, and one of his teachers is the city of Paris -- a real Paris, not an idealized one, but from which Strether has much to learn.  Chad Newsome, of course is there too, and so are a scattering of other Americans, his old friend Waymarsh and his new acquaintance Maria Gostrey among them.  Had Strether his life to live over again, knowing what he has now learned, how different would it be? and what are the lessons he takes home with him?  -  Summary from: https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/

<summary>The Demi-Gods, By James Stephens. 1914</summary>

### The Demi-Gods (4:37)  
https://librivox.org/the-demi-gods-by-james-stephens/  
Text: https://archive.org/details/thedemigods00steprich/page/n7/mode/2up  
By [James Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stephens_(author)) (1882 - 1950). Published 1914.   Reader's Notes:  This book is a lot of fun and the excellent reading/acting by Joe Bergin is a huge plus. Thank you Mr. Bergin!  
Librivox Summary:  
>In this memorialized Irish tale, 3 huge winged demi-gods (part god/part human) have descended to earth to experience human existence. They encounter Patsy Mac Can and his daughter Mary at their campfire one evening, two vagabonds who wander about Ireland with donkey and cart, eating off the land, meeting a variety of dubious characters along the way, who in the great Irish tradition of storytelling, all have stories to tell. The MacCans welcome the strangers, feed them, show them around, along the way spinning yarns and explaining their gypsy "philosophies". Those familiar with Stephens's quirky writing style appreciate him as a quick witted, keen observer, seeing both the ridiculous and the sublime in everyday things, exploring the points of view of various animals and insects as well as the human characters. Eventually the troupe parts company, having forged close bonds of friendship. This is an entertaining adult love story that would not offend a child, read charmingly by authentic Irishman Joe Bergin.

Reading Notes: A novel about timeless characters that still seem populate the elected ranks of Washington, D.C., with an excellent reading by [Nicholas Clifford (1930-2019)](https://librivox.org/reader/4018).  
Librivox Summary:  
>Not until after his death in 1918 was it revealed that Henry Adams was the anonymous author of Democracy, which had been published to great acclaim in 1880. Though the book avoids dates and the characters are fictitious, the setting is no doubt that of Washington in the 1870s, the age of Presidents Grant and Hayes. The young widow, Madeleine Lee, wealthy and independent, is the protagonist, who leaves her New York for Washington to turn her intelligence to politics and to see what makes her country tick. There she meets (among others) Senator Silas P. Ratcliffe of Illinois, one of the most powerful and influential (if somewhat uncultured) men of the capital, who is considering a run for the presidency, and who needs a wife to act as First Lady, a position that (he thinks) Mrs. Lee would admirably fill. Through the book Adams plays with the themes of political necessity, compromise, corruption -- particularly the kind of corporate domination of national politics that he saw becoming all too powerful. Should honest and intelligent men keep their integrity by avoiding politics? Or would that simply mean turning over the governance of the country to power-hungry, scheming, and none too honest hacks? For all the witty conversations in his novel, this was a theme that plagued Adams (a presidential grandson) in life as well as literature, and it is a theme that has by no means disappeared today. - ([Summary by Nicholas Clifford](https://librivox.org/democracy-an-american-novel-by-henry-adams/))

<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes: This story is one way to enhance any study of revolution and civil war in France, and more generally of French history.  Reading by Bruce Pirie makes this an enjoyable audio experience as well.  I assume that for some, there are issues of 18th/19th century female stereotypes and related derogatory terms.  
Summary on Librivox:  
>“The Chouans” (1829) was the first novel published under Balzac’s own name (rather than a pen-name). It became the first book in the great work of his lifetime — the novel series titled “The Human Comedy.”  Balzac was impressed by the writings of Sir Walter Scott. Scott made Scottish history come alive by creating fictions that used real history as backdrop. Balzac’s novel is set in 1799 — the year that Napoleon became First Consul of France. In the far west of France (i.e., Brittany), anti-revolutionary sentiment still simmered. The Chouans were a rustic guerrilla militia who wanted to undo the French Revolution and restore the old Bourbon monarchy. Pitted against them were the forces of the new Republic and its military (“the Blues”). Balzac researched this historical period as well as living conditions for Bretons of that time, then wove into the actual history his own fictional account of a romance between lovers from opposite factions in the dispute.  In “The Chouans,” we see an early and influential example of “historical fiction,” a genre which blossomed in popularity during the 1800s, and remains popular in today’s novels and films.

<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes:  If you have even a microscopic interest in 'Saint Joan' or Middle Ages France, this seems like an excellent little book (*maybe just an essay*).  It assumes that the reader understands some about mid-20th century Brittan and New York, but is still a pleasure in relative ignorance of both.  The reading by David Wales is a perfect match.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Saint Joan is a play by George Bernard Shaw about 15th-century French military figure Joan of Arc. Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play reflects Shaw's belief that the people involved in Joan's trial acted according to what they thought was right. He wrote in his preface to the play: “There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.” (Wikipedia) Modern British author, critic, poet, and broadcaster Clive James, commenting on a book that changed his mind, wrote: “George Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.” (The Guardian, 5 October 2019) [Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales](https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/)

Librivox Summary:  
>The Sun Also Rises (1926) was Hemingway's first novel to be published, though there is his novella The Torrents of Spring which was published earlier in the same year. The novel describes, expressed through the voice of Jake Barnes, a short period of social life that ranges from Paris to locations in Spain. One might say that the action occurs in Pamplona, Spain with the annual festival of San Fermin and its running of bulls and subsequent days of bullfights, but one can easily argue that the real interest of the novel is in its portrayal of the group to which Barnes is a part and how he details their anxieties, frailties, hopes, and frustrations.

Although this book incorporates humor throughout, it was not a *happy* read for me.  It is about a tough time in a tough (*Northwest Michigan*) place and the author expresses his (*or the character's*) energetic prejudices in story-lines that include a Black man and Native Americans.  
Reader's Notes:  
This is an excellent tale read by an excellent performer.  
Librivox and Other 3rd Party Summaries:  
Librivox Summary:  
>The Torrents of Spring was Hemingway's second novel to be published. It would not be wrong to say that it is unique among the author's work as it is a clear parody of Sherwood Anderson's Dark Laughter and full of absurdist humor. Were Hemingway's name not attached to it, one might wonder who actually wrote the novel. The work is a product of its time and the reader is cautioned that there are uncomfortable portrayals of both a Black man and Native Americans. In truth, no one is treated in a sensitive way.

Reading Notes:  This travel journal provides a little access into the brutality of cross-country travel in 1849 in what is now the Southern and Western United States.  
Librivox Summary:  
>"[John Woodhouse Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woodhouse_Audubon) (1812-1862), son of the famous painter [John James Audubon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_James_Audubon) and an artist in his own right, joined Col. Henry Webb's California Company expedition in 1849. From New Orleans the expedition sailed to the Rio Grande; it headed west overland through northern Mexico and through Arizona to San Diego, California. Cholera and outlaws decimated the group. Many of them turned back, including the leader. Audubon assumed command of those remaining and they pushed on to California, although he was forced to abandon his paints and canvases in the desert…. Throughout the whole of this long journey Mr. Audubon took notes of scenes and occurrences by the way. In his descriptions he exhibits the keen observation of the naturalist and the trained eye of the artist. The result is a remarkable picture of social conditions in Mexico, of birds and trees, of sky and mountains and the changing face of nature, of the barrenness of the desert and the difficulties of the journey, of the ruined missions of California, of methods of mining, and of the chaos of races and babel of tongues in the gold fields. It was manifestly impossible to keep a daily journal, and the entries were made from time to time as opportunity occurred. Considering the circumstances under which they were taken, the notes are remarkable for their accuracy. Because it was not edited by Audubon, the text (and this recording) ends abruptly." - ([Summary by [Book Introduction](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/58575/pg58575-images.html#Page_11) and [David Wales](https://librivox.org/audubons-western-journal-1849-1850-by-john-woodhouse-audubon/))

<summary>Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series. By E. E. Smith, 1948</summary>  

### Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series (10:31)  
https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/

<details>
<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  
Reading Notes: Published in 1948 and 1950, the Triplanetary and First Lensman books express a fantastic post-WWII U.S.A. optimism about technology, all things "the Atom," and the supremacy of North American military power. 
The characters that drive the story forward are white male North Americans. 
The lensmen engage in massive death & destruction in their quest for "increasing the general happiness of all humanity" (*a seeming contradiction they don't acknowlege*). 
The most evil characters are leaders and their followers in North American Nationalist politics -- in league with organized crime.  When these politicians & other criminals are caught, they use features of the existing legal system as weapons and delay, delay, delay (*sound like a 'real life' former Present and his lackies?*). A core theme seems to be a battle between the "uncorruptable" (*democrats*) and the "corrupt" (*athoritarians*) -- with "civilization" owing everything to the "uncorruptable." 
There are minor characters from other many planets and galacies.  
Summary:  
>Triplanetary was first serialized in Amazing Stories in 1934. After the [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series) became popular, Smith took his Triplanetary story and turned it into the first of the Lensman series, using it as a prequel to give the back story for the protaganists in the Lensmen series. He added 6 new chapters, doubling it in size and it's really a different book from the serialized novel, being published 14 years after the first. It was put into Gutenberg just last year. 
>The novel covers several episodes in an eons-long eugenics project of the super-intelligences of the Arisia. This alien race is breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their arch enemy, the Eddore. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's (Gharlane of Eddore) reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two and Three. The final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster than light travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, two very important members of the eugenics project, are introduced. They will play the leading roles in the next story, First Lensman.

As (an often comedic) parody this is light, fun entertainment -- materially enhanced by [Ruth Golding's](https://librivox.org/reader/2607) excellent reading.

<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  
Reading Notes: [Dreiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser) wrote these essays about New Yorkers in the context of his time.  They are interesting descriptions of *late 19th century* New York, by a writer with few whose prejudices and *scientific* understanding are unfiltered.  These essays are not for everyone, but may help construct/fortify one's understanding of this time period -- proviging useful color and context for additional reading of this time period.  
Librivox Summary:  This non-fiction work takes place in many areas of New York City in the early 20th Century. Dreiser writes of lives packed into cramped tenements, of the likely end, but perhaps not, of an affair, of those who guided ships through turbulent waters, and of life in a home for retired seamen. We're taken to the new subways where track workers risked deadly accidents as they struggled to earn a living. Animal slaughter, the glory and heartbreak of song-writing, the shabby "sandwich man", deadly jealousy in Little Italy, and much more is vividly brought to life by this brilliant author.

[Phyllis Vincelli](https://librivox.org/life-of-henry-david-thoreau-by-henry-salt/) reports that this early biography by Henry Salt is highly regarded by Thoreau scholars. Be aware that this is a late 19th century biography -- little wandering and uneven.  If you can forgive that, I believe it is a useful introduction to Thoreau well read by "[PhyllisV](https://librivox.org/reader/13055?primary_key=13055&search_category=reader&search_page=1&search_form=get_results)."

Summary from Librivox:  
>Real men don't take guff from snotty kids. Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the "We're Here", a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.  And when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life.

Summary from Librivox:  
>David Langston (a.k.a. the Harvester) is 26 years old and lives a simple life in the Midwest with his dog, cultivating and harvesting trees, plants and herbs near his home that he sells as medicinal ingredients to pharmaceutical houses. When the first bluebird arrives each spring David traditionally asks his dog whether he should remain a bachelor or find a wife. For the first time in six years the dog "advises" him to find a wife. The Harvester is not happy with this advice but that night he has a vision of a very beautiful dark-haired woman in white who slowly walks towards him and bestows a kiss. This vision immediately changes the Harvester’s perspective of his life and he then sets out on a single-minded quest to find this unknown woman whom he is certain will become his wife. But David finds that his pursuit of love is not a straightforward journey. Gene Stratton-Porter endowed the Harvester with strength, honesty, kindness and "always do the right thing" attitude. Many have likened him to Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice fame. The Harvester’s love interest, Ruth, must learn how to love, and be loved, more deeply than she could ever imagine. And with her sharp tongue, Granny dispenses much-needed advice on love and relationships. The Harvester was the #1 selling novel in 1912. The story was made into a silent movie in 1927.

Librivox and Other 3rd Party Summaries:  
Librivox Summary:  
>The Book of Tea is as much about philosophy, religion and art as it is about a drink made with dried leaves in boiling water. It traces the development of tea into teaism. The author’s first paragraph summarizes the whole book:  “Tea began as a medicine and grew into a beverage. In China, in the eighth century, it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements. The fifteenth century saw Japan ennoble it into a religion of aestheticism--Teaism. Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.”  The author shows that the philosophy of Teaism, which was developed from Japanese Zen Buddhist teachings, actually has deeper roots in Chinese Confucianism and Taoism as well.  After its publication in 1906 The Book of Tea provided a window into Japanese culture, and furthered a better understanding and appreciation of the philosophy behind minimalism in Japanese art, architecture, design and living.

<summary>Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning. By Edward Carpenter, 1921</summary>

### Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning  (10:42)

Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1561  
By [Edward Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carpenter) (1844 - 1929)  published 1921  
<details>
<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes:  This book is a bit of a slog and includes quite a bit of repetition.  Carpenter identifies common "religious" language and practices across time and across cultures.  He argues that Christianity is a recent iteration of an "ancient world-religion."  "In the case of Christianity the historical period has lasted nearly 2,000 years, and, as I say, we can hardly expect or wish that it should last much longer."  He sees a deterministic evolution of humanity -- whose psychological development necessitates the emergence of a new phase where "religion" will re-incorporate the natural world, including all communities of human beings (*as opposed to the current 'individualistic' phase*).  His arguements seemed to suggest that the insane waste represented WWI signaled the end of the current phase and announced the coming of the next.  
QUOTE:  
>The whole futile and idiotic structure of commerce and industry in which we are now imprisoned springs from that falsehood of individualistic self-seeking which marks the second stage of human evolution. That stage is already tottering to its fall, destroyed by the very flood of egotistic passions and interests, of vanities, greeds, and cruelties, all warring with each other, which are the sure outcome and culmination of its operation. With the restoration of the sentiment of the Common Life, and the gradual growth of a mental attitude corresponding, there will emerge from the flood something like a solid earth--something on which it will be possible to build with good hope for the future. Schemes of reconstruction are well enough in their way, but if there is no ground of REAL HUMAN SOLIDARITY beneath, of what avail are they?  

Summary from Librivox:  
>In this work from 1921, Carpenter analyzes the origin of Christian beliefs, arguing that they are derived from pre-Christian myths and religions, rather than being new revelations to the human race. He believes that "psychologically man has evolved from simple consciousness to self-consciousness, and is now in process of evolution towards another and more extended kind of consciousness," anticipating a post-Christian era. In the penultimate chapter, "The Exodus of Christianity," he sets out his belief that for Christianity "to hold the field of Religion in the Western World is neither probable nor desirable." Chapters such as "Solar Myths and Christian Festivals," "Rites of Expiation and Redemption," and "The Saviour-God and the Virgin-Mother" analyze his tenet as seen in different contexts.

<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes:  Snowden invests quite a bit of time in describing or just mentioning by name individuals she met or just saw in her travels.  Not being sufficiently well read on this period, I assume that I was unable to draw some of the context that these mentions may have for others (*my being unwilling to research each one of these personalities*).  That said, her descriptions of what she saw and heard of conditions around Europe in the years following WWI provide some depth and color missing from many formal WWI *Histories*.  Snowden also appears to incorporate a heavy load of 19th century wealthy-ruling-class culture -- which, I think, should be considered when reading or listening to her observations and analysis.  It is difficult to understand her noted *pacifism* with her acceptance of (*almost justification of*) the socialist/communist terrorism engulfing Russia at the time.  Snowden's analysis of and hopes for Communist Russia during these murderous years support Galeazzi's summary below  -- that "Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure."  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Written in the aftermath of Word War I, Viscountess Snowden recounts her travels in post war Europe in, as she describes it, "an attempt to do what one person might do, or at least attempt, to restore good feeling between the nations and the normal course of life as quickly as possible." An outspoken pacifist, socialist, and feminist who nonetheless strongly denounced the Bolsheviks, Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure. whose views and observations offer a unique perspective on Europe in the '20s.

Reader Notes:  
This book invests a lot of effort in establishing some of the context surrounding the reign of Queen Elizabeth.  These include, but are not limited to: The evolution of religion in Germany, England, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the rise of Protestantism.  Catholic reaction to these changes.  France, England, and Scotland.  Key personalities involved.  The Jesuits, and more.  It was an enjoyable listen and I *learned* a lot.  The author builds a confident narrative throughout.  But it is important to keep in mind that this book was published in 1875, and more current examinations of this period may build varying narratives...  
Librivox Summary:  
>This short history by the eminent British historian, Mandell Creighton, places Elizabeth and her reign within the context of 16th century European political, religious, and military events. Elizabeth overcomes her two great rivals, King Philip of Spain and Mary, Queen of Scots. England gradually unites behind her Queen, who survives multiple assassination plots. After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the English, lightly taxed by their frugal sovereign, launch flourishing commerce enterprises. The author writes of the Protestant Reformation that "a change of belief meant a revolt from authority." In this age of individualism, personal daring, and a consciousness of national greatness, the golden age of Elizabethan literature breaks new ground in historiography, literary theory, poetry, and above all, drama. - ([Summary by Pamela Nagami, M.D.](https://librivox.org/the-age-of-elizabeth-by-mandell-creighton/))

<summary>Edward III. By William Parsons Warburton, 1908</summary>

### Edward III (9:40)  
https://librivox.org/edward-iii-by-william-warburton/  
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.86381  
By [William Parsons Warburton](https://warburton.one-name.net/clans/Garryhinch/ps01/ps01_052.html) (1826 - 1913)  Published 1908  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Edward III reigned for fifty years, from 1327 to 1377. William Warburton writes that "the backbone of the story of his reign and times is the great Continental war...He was a genuine Englishman in his rough and ready, and often incoherent policy; in his contempt for foreigners and his audacious confidence in himself and his countrymen; in his love of manly exertion; his personal pride and popular sympathies, and his freedom from lasting enmity and vindictiveness...It is in vain for cold reason to contend against the spell of the names of Creci and Poitiers; they will forever stir the English heart like the blast of a trumpet or the rustle of a consecrated banner; but these battles are not, after all, the true titles of the age to honour. Searching deeper down we shall find, and thankfully admit, that the century was one not of conquest, but of transition, development, emancipation, and characterised by a silent and gradual contraction of the area of privilege, and a corresponding enlargement of the area of liberty."

Reading Notes:  This is not a traditional biography.  It is worth a couple hours while pulling weeds, gardening, dusting, etc. but I cannot recommend it to anyone wanting a 'traditional' biography of Rodin or a review of his artistic work.   
Librivox Summary:  
>Rodin has pronounced Rilke's essay the supreme interpretation of his work. (From the translators’ Preface)  

>Auguste Rodin, 1840-1917, was a French sculptor. Although Rodin is generally considered the progenitor of modern sculpture, he did not set out to rebel against the past. He was schooled traditionally, took a craftsman-like approach to his work, and desired academic recognition, although he was never accepted into Paris's foremost school of art. Sculpturally, Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, deeply pocketed surface in clay. … Rodin… modeled the human body with realism, and celebrated individual character and physicality. From the unexpected realism of his first major figure… to the unconventional memorials whose commissions he later sought, Rodin's reputation grew, such that he became the preeminent French sculptor of his time. By 1900, he was a world-renowned artist.  

>Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926) was a Bohemian-Austrian poet and novelist, "widely recognized as one of the most lyrically intense German-language poets", writing in both verse and highly lyrical prose. Several critics have described Rilke's work as inherently "mystical"…. [Rilke’s] encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved in the sculpture of Rodin, and then with the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation… - ([Summary from the Foreword by Herman George Scheffauer](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61284))

See the [summary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_in_Imperio)  
Reading Notes:  Published in 1899, this seems like an important contribution to African American utopian literature.  This novel also incorporates a realistic spectrum of violence and racism experienced across the U.S. South.  If you can make it to the last hour of the recording, it also includes passionate arguments about the pursuit of political and economic justice.  Unfortunately, the audio book's reader has a flat, monotone presentation that is not a good match for the content of the text.  If you are able, it may be more enjoyable for many to just read the [text available on gutenburg.org](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/15454).

Reading Summary: Like a number of E.L.Sabin's works, this is *historical-fiction-for-young-readers*, and is a sweeping overview, without a lot of **exploration** detail.  It is primarily a light, shallow drama focused on a small subset of the Lewis & Clark team...  The presentation is an assembly of numerous readers, which may not bring joy to every listener.  That said, it is an entertaining story that moves along throughout.  NOTE: There are issues of race in this story-telling, particularly Native American and Black stereotypes and derogatory terms.

>One of the significant and astounding explorations, in 1804-1806, was the expedition under the leadership of Captain Meriwether Lewis and Captain William Clark opening up a trail from St. Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Coast at the mouth of the mighty Columbia River.

[Summary by Book Review Digest, v.12 (1916-1917)](https://librivox.org/i-spy-by-natalie-sumner-lincoln/):  
>Here is a novel whose pregnant caption suits these parlous times. . . . It's all about a German spy plot to steal two American inventions deemed of inestimable value for war use. One is a camera for taking a map of the country from an airship. The other is a process for making glass armor—coats of mail of interwoven mica and glass that Mauser bullets cannot penetrate. Washington, D. C., is the locale. . . . Almost everybody turns out to be a bit of a spy, and the last unraveling chapter certainly carries the element of complete surprise.

When the first interstellar transport in 30 years arrived on Halsey's Planet, it brought things to a head. The ship had touched on six other colony worlds - and all six had been devoid of human life. Where was everybody? It was almost as if humankind, when separated by cosmic distances from Mother Earth, could not survive. He didn't know the answer but he knew it all smelled highly of decay.

<summary>Reading Notes and Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reader Notes:  
I enjoyed this summary of a "*typical*" Western understanding of how the world was "*discovered*" (up to the mid-1890s).  It aligns with much of what I was taught in high school and college, though it is no longer the narrative I would attach to these discoveries and conquests.  
Some might be turned off by how the author ignores oppression built around the concepts of race, caste, and class throughout his descriptions of how Europeans claimed lands across the globe.  I believe they are expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of the readers he targeted at the time.  He makes no attempt to deal with negative outcomes of colonization.  Not only were land and resources stolen in the colonization process but colonization was both a cultural and literal genocide -- ignoring the value of indigenous peoples.  The impacts of colonization continue through today.  This book may be hurtful to some.  
Librivox Summary:  
>This book was first published in 1897. It's a short work, but it encompasses a vast subject—nothing less than determining the detailed geographical plan of our entire world! In the process, Jacobs feeds us dates and names and events and places and maps in a dense stream. It's a bit like drinking from a fire hose, but see it through, and the reader (or listener) will acquire a surprisingly complete overview of world history as well as geography. It's well worth absorbing, even by those not so geographically inclined, if only as a source for winning endless bar bets. Beginning in ancient times, the author identifies three main forces that have contributed to our present understanding: wars of conquest, competition for trade, and (eventually) pure scientific curiosity. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, early Greeks, Babylonians, and many other Mediterranean peoples contributed, often unwillingly, the streams of knowledge that Ptolemy of Alexandria summed up in the great Ptolemaei Orbis (ca.150 AD), the first “real” map of the whole known world. The evolution of world maps to incorporate (and sometime conceal) new discoveries is a key theme of this fascinating work.

Reader's Notes:  
This is a seriously-dystopian novel...  For some, it might be a useful reminder of their high school or college studies of late 19th and early 20th century social, economic and cultural struggles in the United States.  Its thumping Socialism (*and the fact that Jack London invested so much time in this story*) is a reminder of how it was, for a time, a real force in the U.S.  Written and published before 1909, it is also interesting to compare some of The Iron Heal content against the facts of American history through the 1930s.  London's overwrought prose about organized labor, mega-capitalists, and corruption throughout government institutions may make this novel radioactive for some.

<summary>Reading Notes and  Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes: This report covers an ugly period of Western colonization and genicide.  In roughly a 50-year period, the Spanish, the Catholics, and their surrogates killed millions of indigenous peoples in what is now the Americas.  From that perspective, it provides a contemporary, sometimes first-hand account of a period of which one should maintain a threshold understanding.  Written in the 16th century for delivery to the Spanish king and then translated (possibly serially), this report is constructed in a manner unfamiliar and not particularly attractive to me.  In addition, the recording was uneven and made this book a difficult slog.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (Spanish: Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias) is an account written by the Spanish Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas in 1542 (published in 1552) about the mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas in colonial times and sent to then Prince Philip II of Spain. One of the stated purposes for writing the account is his fear of Spain coming under divine punishment and his concern for the souls of the Native Peoples. The account is one of the first attempts by a Spanish writer of the colonial era to depict examples of unfair treatment that indigenous people endured in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Greater Antilles, particularly the island of Hispaniola. Las Casas's point of view can be described as being heavily against some of the Spanish methods of colonization, which, as he describes, have inflicted a great loss on the indigenous occupants of the islands. - ([Summary by Wikipedia](https://librivox.org/a-brief-account-of-the-destruction-of-the-indies-by-bartolome-de-las-casas/))

<summary>Reading Notes and  Librivox Summary:</summary>  

Reading Notes:
This is just another relatively fast moving WWI spy novel.  It incorporates some of the worst cultural issues of the time (*written in the 2nd decade of the 20th century by a 19th century writer*)...  I believe they are expressions of the author's understanding of the world and that of the readers he targeted.  He makes no attempt to deal with negative outcomes of institutionalized descrimination, colonization and war, or of cultural and literal genocide -- ignoring the value numerous peoples.  The impacts of these events continue through today.  This book may be hurtful to some.  
Summary from Librivox:  
>Hannay is called in to investigate rumours of an uprising in the Muslim world and undertakes a perilous journey through enemy territory to meet his friend Sandy in Constantinople. Once there, he and his friends must thwart the Germans' plans to use religion to help them win the war, climaxing at the battle of Erzurum.

Reading Notes:  
The interesting biography of William Falconer was more enjoyable than the extensive poem.  The style and some content of the poetry may turn some off, but it includes some excellent rhymes (*think song lyrics*).  
>"William Falconer's "The Shipwreck" recounts the final voyage of the merchant ship Britannia and her crew.  See the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) summary at: https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/library-archive/shipwreck-william-falconer  
>[RMG Digital Resources Librarian 'Renee' says](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/blog/william-falconers-shipwreck): "Part fiction, part autobiography and part instructional guide for sailors, William Falconer's poem The Shipwreck is a must-read for Patrick O'Brian fans. Fair enough, there's no Jack Aubrey character - but the combination of high seas drama and technical detail makes for a surprisingly compelling read."  
>Librivox Summary: A semi-autobiographical poem in three cantos recounts the wreck of the merchant ship Britannia. Written by William Falconer, a seaman of some experience, who survived one shipwreck himself with only two others of the 50 man crew and eventually perished in the loss of a second ship, the frigate Aurora, 20 years later. The poem is recognized for its realistic portrayal of life aboard an 18th century sailing vessel. [Summary by Fritz](https://librivox.org/the-shipwreck-by-william-falconer/)

Other 3rd party summaries:  
>Based on the events of the last days of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (better known as Cato the Younger) (95–46 BC), a Stoic whose deeds, rhetoric and resistance to the tyranny of Julius Caesar made him an icon of republicanism, virtue, and liberty. Addison's play deals with many themes such as individual liberty versus government tyranny, republicanism versus monarchism, logic versus emotion, and Cato's personal struggle to hold to his beliefs in the face of death [Summary from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato,_a_Tragedy). 
This play was supposedly staged by George Washington after the winter of 1778 at Valley Forge as an inspiration to his officers on self-sacrificing republican virtues. Many quotes of American revolution leaders - Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or Give me death" and Nathan Hale's "I only regret I have but one life to lose for my country" - are drawn from this play.

Librivox Summary:  
>The kind reception by the American press of the author's first journey to the great southern sea, and its republication in Great Britain and in France ... have encouraged him to give the public a companion volume, "FOUR MONTHS IN A SNEAK-BOX" ... a relation of ... a second cruise to the Gulf of Mexico ... by a different route from that followed in the "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE." This time the author procured one of the smallest and most comfortable of boats... the BARNEGAT SNEAK-BOX. This curious and stanch little craft, though only twelve feet in length, proved a most comfortable and serviceable home while the author rowed in it more than 2600 miles down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, until he reached the goal of his voyage — the mouth of the wild Suwanee River — which was the terminus of his "VOYAGE OF THE PAPER CANOE."

Librivox Summary:  
>A genuine cowboy who speaks a bit of Greek? Ditto a bit of The Litany? And more than a little verse, including (would you believe?) Alice In Wonderland. What kind of young man do we have here? And a young woman who matches him without effort? And a definitely literate narrator with his tongue firmly inserted in cheek. There’s a bank robbery and an attempted murder. A desperate ride across the desert and a warm welcome by good Mexican friends. It’s all a great deal of fun. Eugene Manlove Rhodes (1869 – 1934) was an American writer, nicknamed the "cowboy chronicler". He lived in south central New Mexico when the first cattle ranching and cowboys arrived in the area; when he moved to New York with his wife in 1899, he wrote stories of the American West that set the image of cowboy life in that era. Originally Published under the title of Bransford In Arcadia Or The Little Eohippus (1913). Note: eohippus, which plays a part all through the story, is the small prehistoric five-toed ancestor of the modern-day horse - ([Summary by [David Wales](https://librivox.org/bransford-of-rainbow-range-by-eugene-manlove-rhodes/))

Librivox Summary:  
>In 1837, the Danish Royal Society of Sciences offered a prize to any essayist who could satisfactorily answer the question, "Is the fountain and basis of Morals to be sought for in an idea of morality which lies directly in the consciousness (or conscience), and in the analysis of the other leading ethical conceptions which arise from it? Or is it to be found in some other source of knowledge?" The Basis of Morality is the essay submitted in 1840 by German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In it, he first mercilessly deconstructs the prevailing Western theory of morality as championed by Immanuel Kant, among others, before establishing a series of maxims and thought experiments which lead him to a conclusion which points squarely at compassion as the cardinal virtue upon which all morality rests. In the appendix to this essay, he links his own conclusion with the conclusions reached millennia earlier by the authors of the Vedas and Upanishads. The essay was ultimately rejected for the prize despite being the only entry, a minor scandal with some speculation that the result was due in no small part to Schopenhauer's onslaught against Hegel—the judge of the contest being the author of a Hegelian theory of morals.

Librivox Summary:  
>The Freelands family is a mixture: Tod Freeland is an uncommunicative gentle giant, his wife Kirsteen passionate and free-spoken, Felix is a literary man, Stanley the man of business, John is in politics. Their mother is a practical uncomprehending old lady while Nedda and Derek, the younger generation and cousins, fall head over heels in love.  The story revolves around the ‘land question’ which was the chief matter of moment when the novel was written – British agriculture was depressed as imported food (chiefly from the USA) meant that domestic farmers were struggling. The rich landowners pay scant attention to the wishes and rights of the labourers on their land. The Freelands find themselves on both sides of the divide and the ensuing struggle involves them all. There is therefore much social commentary in the book, but it is also a tender love story and an insight into how different members of one family can think differently while still bonded together.

Summary from Librivox:  
>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by Vicente Blasco Ibañez and translated into English by Charlotte Brewster Jordan, depicts two branches of a family with its roots in the pampas of Argentina. The wealthy Argentinian, Julio Madariaga, comes from Spain and raises himself from poverty, becoming a self-made, wealthy cattleman. He is a man of extremes; an honest man with a rascally knack for taking advantage of others; a self-made man with overweening pride, prejudices, and a sharp, flinty temper that can spark into violence, he is at the same time given to great generosity toward those who are under him. This almost feudal lord has two daughters who marry expatriates, a Frenchman and a German.  Julio Madariaga leaves his stamp on these two families who, after his death, return to the native countries of his two sons in law. At that time, the mood of Europe is in many ways similar to that of the old gaucho, a mixture of generosity, explosive anger, romanticism, strong prejudices, and wounded pride, a mood composed of extremes painted on an oversized canvas. World War I is waiting in the wings and will leave its own stamp on the old gaucho's lineage, pitting them against each other on opposite sides in the violent first year that many think will last only a few months but will, in fact, result in improbable destruction and loss of lives. An old Russian visionary given to drink, looks out on red skies one day and experiences its coming in a vision: hoofbeats; and riders.
