### The Ambassadors (16:46)  
https://librivox.org/the-ambassadors-by-henry-james/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambassadors  
https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/432  
By **Henry James** (1843 - 1916), published 1903  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James  
I recommend this excellent 19th century novel to anyone who had the time to think about their place and role in the world... 
Summary from Librivox:  
Henry James considered The Ambassadors his best, or perhaps his best-wrought, novel. It plays on the great Jamesian theme of the American abroad, who finds himself in an older, and some would say richer, culture that that of the United States, with its attractions and dangers.  
Here the protagonist is Lambert Strether, a man in his fifties, editor of a small literary magazine in Woollett, Massachusetts, who arrives in Europe on a mission undertaken at the urging of his patron, Mrs. Newsome, to bring back her son Chadwick. 
That young man appears to be enjoying his time in Paris rather more than seems good for him, at least to those older and wiser. 
The novel, however, is perhaps really about Strether's education in this new land, and one of his teachers is the city of Paris -- a real Paris, not an idealized one, but from which Strether has much to learn.  
Chad Newsome, of course is there too, and so are a scattering of other Americans, his old friend Waymarsh and his new acquaintance Maria Gostrey among them.  
Had Strether his life to live over again, knowing what he has now learned, how different would it be? and what are the lessons he takes home with him?  

### Atlantis  (13:59)  
https://librivox.org/atlantis-by-gerhart-hauptmann/  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17241  
By [Gerhart Hauptmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann) (1862 - 1946)  
Translated by **Adele Szold Seltzer** (1876 - 1940)  
Summary from Librivox:  
Frederick von Kammacher is a young doctor in Germany whose wife has gone insane, whose children are in a boarding school, and whose career has been destroyed by some faulty research he has done. He becomes infatuated with a teenage dancer, and on a whim he boards the the same steamship the dancer is on bound for New York. Hauptmann was heralded as a seer for his description of what happens to their steamship mid-ocean, and what in reality happened to the Titanic only months later.  

### Kings, Queens and Pawns: An American Woman at the Front  (10:27)  
https://librivox.org/kings-queens-and-pawns-by-mary-roberts-rinehart/  
https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14457  
By [Mary Roberts Rinehart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Roberts_Rinehart) (1876 - 1958)  Published 1915  
Summary from Librivox:  
A personal account of the American author's visit to Europe in January 1915 while a war correspondent in Belgium for The Saturday Evening Post. She writes: "War is not two great armies meeting in a clash and frenzy of battle. It is much more than that. War is a boy carried on a stretcher, looking up at God's blue sky with bewildered eyes that are soon to close; war is a woman carrying a child that has been wounded by a shell; war is spirited horses tied in burning buildings and waiting for death; war is the flower of a race, torn, battered, hungry, bleeding, up to its knees in icy water; war is an old woman burning a candle before the Mater Dolorosa for the son she has given.  

### Edward III (9:40)  
https://librivox.org/edward-iii-by-william-warburton/  
https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.86381  
By [William Parsons Warburton](https://warburton.one-name.net/clans/Garryhinch/ps01/ps01_052.html) (1826 - 1913)  
Edward III reigned for fifty years, from 1327 to 1377. William Warburton writes that "the backbone of the story of his reign and times is the great Continental war...He was a genuine Englishman in his rough and ready, and often incoherent policy; in his contempt for foreigners and his audacious confidence in himself and his countrymen; in his love of manly exertion; his personal pride and popular sympathies, and his freedom from lasting enmity and vindictiveness...It is in vain for cold reason to contend against the spell of the names of Creci and Poitiers; they will forever stir the English heart like the blast of a trumpet or the rustle of a consecrated banner; but these battles are not, after all, the true titles of the age to honour. Searching deeper down we shall find, and thankfully admit, that the century was one not of conquest, but of transition, development, emancipation, and characterised by a silent and gradual contraction of the area of privilege, and a corresponding enlargement of the area of liberty." ([Summary](https://librivox.org/edward-iii-by-william-warburton/) by Pamela Nagami, M.D.)

https://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2186  
By [Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling) (1868 - 1936), published 1897  
Summary from Librivox:  
Real men don't take guff from snotty kids. Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the "We're Here", a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There's no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won't take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.  
And when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life.  

### Blake of the "Rattlesnake"  (5:21)  
https://librivox.org/blake-of-the-rattlesnake-by-frederick-thomas-jane/

By [Frederick Thomas Jane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_T._Jane) (1865 - 1916)  Published 1895    
Summary from Librivox:  
Fred Jane, who later went on to publish his famous "Jane's Fighting Ships", doubtless was noting the success of other books that forecast a British defeat in the event of war in the late 19th century when he wrote this fictional account of "The Man Who Saved England." Jane tells of a possible war against both France and Russia with plenty of verve and derring-do amid naval battles, both small and large.

### Saint Joan: Preface  (2:12)  
https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joan_(play)  
Text: https://archive.org/details/SaintJoan/page/n1  
George Bernard Shaw (1856 - 1950)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw  
Saint Joan is a play by George Bernard Shaw about 15th-century French military figure Joan of Arc. Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play reflects Shaw's belief that the people involved in Joan's trial acted according to what they thought was right. He wrote in his preface to the play: “There are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.” (Wikipedia) Modern British author, critic, poet, and broadcaster Clive James, commenting on a book that changed his mind, wrote: “George Bernard Shaw, his preface to Saint Joan. Reading that wonderful stretch of prose started me on the road to a more human version of Christianity: a road I like to think that I am still pursuing.” (The Guardian, 5 October 2019) [Summary by Wikipedia and David Wales](https://librivox.org/saint-joan-preface-by-george-bernard-shaw/)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Snowden  
Written in the aftermath of Word War I, Viscountess Snowden recounts her travels in post war Europe in, as she describes it, "an attempt to do what one person might do, or at least attempt, to restore good feeling between the nations and the normal course of life as quickly as possible." An outspoken pacifist, socialist, and feminist who nonetheless strongly denounced the Bolsheviks, Snowden was a controversial and polarizing figure. whose views and observations offer a unique perspective on Europe in the '20s.

### Triplanetary, First in the Lensman Series (10:31)  
https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706  
By [E. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith) (1890 - 1965)  published 1948  
Triplanetary was first serialized in Amazing Stories in 1934. After the [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series) became popular, Smith took his Triplanetary story and turned it into the first of the Lensman series, using it as a prequel to give the back story for the protaganists in the Lensmen series. He added 6 new chapters, doubling it in size and it's really a different book from the serialized novel, being published 14 years after the first. It was put into Gutenberg just last year. 
The novel covers several episodes in an eons-long eugenics project of the super-intelligences of the Arisia. This alien race is breeding two genetic lines to become the ultimate weapon in Arisia's cosmic war with their arch enemy, the Eddore. The initial chapters cover the Kinnison genetic line during the fall of Atlantis and Nero's (Gharlane of Eddore) reign in Rome. These tales were inserted into the novel following the serialized release, along with chapters covering members of the Kinnison line in World Wars One, Two and Three. The final chapter of Triplanetary tells of the discovery of the inertialess drive that allows faster than light travel. Patrolman Conway Costigan and his friends engage in a space battle with Gray Roger the pirate gangster. This conflict is complicated by the arrival of the technologically superior, extra-Solar, amphibian-like Nevians, resulting in the first interstellar war involving humans. In this story Virgil Samms and Roderick Kinnison, two very important members of the eugenics project, are introduced. They will play the leading roles in the next story, First Lensman. (Summary by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary_(novel)) and [Phil Chenevert](https://librivox.org/triplanetary-first-in-the-lensman-series-by-e-e-doc-smith/))

By [E. E. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith) (1890 - 1965)  published 1950  
The Secret Planet. No human had ever landed on the hidden planet of Arisia. A mysterious space barrier turned back both men and ships. Then the word came to Earth, "Go to Arisia!", Virgil Samms of the Galactic Patrol went--and came back with the Lens, the strange device that gave its wearer powers no man had ever possessed before. Samms knew the price of that power would be high. But even he had no idea of the ultimate cost, and the weird destiny waiting for the First Lensman. First Lensman is the sequel to Triplanetary, and the second book of E.E. "Doc" Smith's classic [Lensman series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lensman_series).

### The Harvester (16:48)  
https://librivox.org/the-harvester-by-gene-stratton-porter-2/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/349  
By [Gene Stratton-Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Stratton-Porter) (1863 - 1924)  published 1911  
David Langston (a.k.a. the Harvester) is 26 years old and lives a simple life in the Midwest with his dog, cultivating and harvesting trees, plants and herbs near his home that he sells as medicinal ingredients to pharmaceutical houses. When the first bluebird arrives each spring David traditionally asks his dog whether he should remain a bachelor or find a wife. For the first time in six years the dog "advises" him to find a wife. The Harvester is not happy with this advice but that night he has a vision of a very beautiful dark-haired woman in white who slowly walks towards him and bestows a kiss. This vision immediately changes the Harvester’s perspective of his life and he then sets out on a single-minded quest to find this unknown woman whom he is certain will become his wife. But David finds that his pursuit of love is not a straightforward journey. Gene Stratton-Porter endowed the Harvester with strength, honesty, kindness and "always do the right thing" attitude. Many have likened him to Mr. Darcy of Pride and Prejudice fame. The Harvester’s love interest, Ruth, must learn how to love, and be loved, more deeply than she could ever imagine. And with her sharp tongue, Granny dispenses much-needed advice on love and relationships. The Harvester was the #1 selling novel in 1912. The story was made into a silent movie in 1927.

Natalie Sumner Lincoln (1881 - 1935)  published 1916  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Sumner_Lincoln  
Here is a novel whose pregnant caption suits these parlous times. . . . It's all about a German spy plot to steal two American inventions deemed of inestimable value for war use. One is a camera for taking a map of the country from an airship. The other is a process for making glass armor—coats of mail of interwoven mica and glass that Mauser bullets cannot penetrate. Washington, D. C., is the locale. . . . Almost everybody turns out to be a bit of a spy, and the last unraveling chapter certainly carries the element of complete surprise.

### The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse  (16:27)  
https://librivox.org/the-four-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-by-vincent-blasco-ibanez/  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse_(novel)  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1484  
Vicente Blasco Ibáñez (1867 - 1928)  published 1916, and 1918 English translation by Charlotte Brewster Jordan  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Blasco_Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez  
Translated by Charlotte Jordan Brewster (1862 - 1945)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Brewster_Jordan  
http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Brewster_Jordan  
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by Vicente Blasco Ibañez and translated into English by Charlotte Brewster Jordan, depicts two branches of a family with its roots in the pampas of Argentina. The wealthy Argentinian, Julio Madariaga, comes from Spain and raises himself from poverty, becoming a self-made, wealthy cattleman. He is a man of extremes; an honest man with a rascally knack for taking advantage of others; a self-made man with overweening pride, prejudices, and a sharp, flinty temper that can spark into violence, he is at the same time given to great generosity toward those who are under him. This almost feudal lord has two daughters who marry expatriates, a Frenchman and a German.  Julio Madariaga leaves his stamp on these two families who, after his death, return to the native countries of his two sons in law. At that time, the mood of Europe is in many ways similar to that of the old gaucho, a mixture of generosity, explosive anger, romanticism, strong prejudices, and wounded pride, a mood composed of extremes painted on an oversized canvas. World War I is waiting in the wings and will leave its own stamp on the old gaucho's lineage, pitting them against each other on opposite sides in the violent first year that many think will last only a few months but will, in fact, result in improbable destruction and loss of lives. An old Russian visionary given to drink, looks out on red skies one day and experiences its coming in a vision: hoofbeats; and riders.

Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31592  
Joseph Addison (1672 - 1719)  published 1712  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Addison  
Based on the events of the last days of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (better known as Cato the Younger) (95–46 BC), a Stoic whose deeds, rhetoric and resistance to the tyranny of Julius Caesar made him an icon of republicanism, virtue, and liberty. Addison's play deals with many themes such as individual liberty versus government tyranny, republicanism versus monarchism, logic versus emotion, and Cato's personal struggle to hold to his beliefs in the face of death [Summary from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato,_a_Tragedy). 
This play was supposedly staged by George Washington after the winter of 1778 at Valley Forge as an inspiration to his officers on self-sacrificing republican virtues. Many quotes of American revolution leaders - Patrick Henry's "Give me liberty or Give me death" and Nathan Hale's "I only regret I have but one life to lose for my country" - are drawn from this play.

### The Color of a Great City  (8:36)  
https://librivox.org/the-color-of-a-great-city-by-theodore-dreiser/  
Text: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61043  
Theodore Dreiser (1871 - 1945)  published 1923  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dreiser  
This non-fiction work takes place in many areas of New York City in the early 20th Century. Dreiser writes of lives packed into cramped tenements, of the likely end, but perhaps not, of an affair, of those who guided ships through turbulent waters, and of life in a home for retired seamen. We're taken to the new subways where track workers risked deadly accidents as they struggled to earn a living. Animal slaughter, the glory and heartbreak of song-writing, the shabby "sandwich man", deadly jealousy in Little Italy, and much more is vividly brought to life by this brilliant author.

Henry Salt (1851 - 1939)  published 1890  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Stephens_Salt  
Henry David Thoreau was a fascinating man, contributing vast amounts of information on nature history, leading the way for environmentalism. He also was a philosopher, abolitionist, anarchist, writer, poet, and a bit of a mystery. He is best known for his book 'Walden', and his essay on 'Civil Disobedience'. This early biography by Henry Salt is highly regarded by Thoreau scholars. [Summary by Phyllis Vincelli](https://librivox.org/life-of-henry-david-thoreau-by-henry-salt/)  


### Pagan & Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning  (10:42)  
https://librivox.org/pagan-christian-creeds-their-origin-and-meaning-by-edward-carpenter/  
Edward Carpenter (1844 - 1929)  published 1921  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Carpenter  
In this work from 1921, Carpenter analyzes the origin of Christian beliefs, arguing that they are derived from pre-Christian myths and religions, rather than being new revelations to the human race. He believes that "psychologically man has evolved from simple consciousness to self-consciousness, and is now in process of evolution towards another and more extended kind of consciousness," anticipating a post-Christian era. In the penultimate chapter, "The Exodus of Christianity," he sets out his belief that for Christianity "to hold the field of Religion in the Western World is neither probable nor desirable." Chapters such as "Solar Myths and Christian Festivals," "Rites of Expiation and Redemption," and "The Saviour-God and the Virgin-Mother" analyze his tenet as seen in different contexts.
