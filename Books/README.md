<summary>Reading Notes: </summary>

This story has enormous scope, incorporating a broad spectrum of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes) and [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_ideas_in_science_fiction) themes as it builds out science, technology, religion, and secular societies across multiple worlds.  
Some Quotes:  
>Its general import is that one should never believe a thing only because one wishes that it were true.  
>They knew many things but had no idea why.  And strangely this made them more, rather than less, certain that they were right.  
>"That is the kind of beauty that I was trying to get you to see," Orolo told me. "Nothing is more important than that you see and love the beauty that is right in front of you, or else you will have no defense against the ugliness that will hem you in and come at you in so many ways."  
>Thousands of years ago, the work that people did had been broken down into jobs that were the same every day, in organizations where people were interchangeable parts.  All of the story had been bled out of their lives.  That was how it had to be; it was how you got a productive economy.  But it would be easy to see a will at work behind this: not exactly an evil will, but a selfish will.  The people who made this system thus were jealous, not of money and not of power but of story.  If their employees came home at day's end with interesting stories to tell, it meant something had gone wrong...  
>There is no longer superposition.  No wavefunction collapse.  Just a lot of copies of me -- of my brain -- each really existing in a different parallel cosmos.  The cosmos model residing in each of those parallel brains is really, definitely in one state or another.  And they interfere with one another.  
>Quantum interference -- the crosstalk among similar quantum states -- knits the different versions of your brain together.  
>Hearing was worse than useless; I was sorry I'd been born with ears.  
>And it happened all the time that the compromise between two perfectly rational altrnatives was something that made no sense at all.  
>There is one universe, by the definition of *universe*. It is not the cosmos we see through our eyes and our telescopes -- *that* is but a single Narrative, a thread winding through a Hemm space shared by many other Narratives besides ours.  Each Narrative looks like a cosmos alone, to any consciousness that partakes of it.  
>...the only way to determine the direction of time's arrow was to measure the amount of disorder in a system. The cosmos seems oblivious to time.  It only matters to us.  Consciousness is time-constituting.  We build time up out of instantaneous impressions that flow in through our sensory organs at each moment.  
>We don't give our consciousness sufficient credit for its ability to take in noisy, ambiguous, contradictory givens from the senses, and sort it out... to confer *thisness* on what we perceive.  ...absolutely necessary from an evolutionary standpoint...  
>The full cosmos consists of the physical stuff and consciousness.  Take away the consciouness and it's only dust; add consciousness and you get things, ideas, and time.  
>"All right, already!  I get it! The Hylaean Flow brings about convergent development of consciousness-bearing systems across worldtracks!  But where is the payoff?  There's got to be more to it than this big ship roaming from cosmos to cosmos collecting sample populations and embalming them in spheres."  
>I thought that I was like a man lame in one leg, who learned to move about well enough that all awareness of his disability had passed out of his mind.  And yet, when he tried to go on a journey, he kept finding himself back where he had started, since his weak leg made him go in circles.  But if he found a partner who was weak in the other leg, and the two of them set out as companions...  
>Then I happened to glance down at the coffin beside my knee, and wondered... Who had given the order...  
>There are certain worldtracks -- certain states of affairs -- that are only compatible with certain persons' being...absent.  
>Upsight: A sudden, usually unlooked-for moment of clear understanding.  
>The mystic nails a symbol to one meaning that was true for a moment but soon becomes false.  The poet, on the other hand, sees that truth *while it's true* but understands that symbols are always in flux and that their meanings are fleeting.... Anyway, my point is that guys like Flec have a weakness, almost a kind of addiction, for the mystical, as opposed to poetic, way of using their minds.  
>...the evolution of our minds from bits of inanimate matter was more beautiful and more extraordinary than any of the miracles cataloged down through the ages by the religions of our world. And so he had an instinctive skepticism of any system of thought, religious or theorical, that pretended to encompass that miracle, and in so doing sought to draw limits around it.  
>I was an adjunct professor, which means that I was given the most unpleasant and unrewarding teaching assignments with no opportunity for university-supported research, no job security, and no benefits.  Also the pay was terrible...  
>Well, that would challenge certain assumptions about the nature of reality that I did not even know I had.

<summary>The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.  By Neal Stephenson  1995</summary>

### The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age  
By [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)  
Published 1995  
Summary:  
..."nanotechnology made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what *should* be done with it had become far more important than imagining what *could* be done with it." (page 37)  This book [covers a lot of territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age).  Written in the early 1990s, Stephenson created a world in the 3rd or 4th decade of the 21st century where nanotechnology had changed *everything* and humanity was characterized by extreme tribalism.

<summary>Darwin's Ghosts: In Search of the First Evolutionists. By Rebecca Stott.  2012</summary>  

### Darwin's Ghosts: In Search of the First Evolutionists.  
https://catalog.urbandalelibrary.org/polaris/search/title.aspx?ctx=3.1033.0.0.3&pos=4&cn=146154  
By [Stott, Rebecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Stott)  (1964 - ___)  
<details>
<summary>Reader's Notes, Librivox and Other 3rd Party Summaries:</summary> 

Reader's Notes: From the highest level, "Darwin's Ghosts" is "[2,200-year history of Darwin's predecessors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Stott)" along with investigating how the work of those individuals on the origins of life influenced the arts and popular culture.  The author investigates the idea of "transmutation" [more thoroughly than did Darwin](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/darwins-ghosts-rebecca-stott-review). Example... While Europe drug through the middle ages Viking long boats were invading Britain, in Basra and Bagdad, elites paid for the expansion and distribution of knwoledge...  Ninth century Abbasid empire scholar called [al-Jāḥiẓ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahiz) was part of a corp of translators, translating earlier manuscripts while also creating new books.  al-Jāḥiẓ, "to fulfil his moral obligation to God, an obligation enjoined by the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran) to look closely and search for understanding," wrote about nature's interconnectedness, ecosystems and survival of the fittest in his unfinished, 7-volume book of "Living Beings"...  Stott moves on through contributions of [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), [Leonardo da Vinci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci), [Benoît de Maillet (Telliamed)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_de_Maillet), [Bernard Palissy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Palissy), [Abraham Tremblay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Trembley), [Denis Diderot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot), [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck), [Constantine Samuel Rafinesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Samuel_Rafinesque), [Robert Edmond Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Edmond_Grant), [Robert Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Chambers_(publisher,_born_1802)), [Alfred Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace) and more.  Many of them performed their investigations and built their arguments/explanations in the context of "governing" bodies and accompanying systems which demanded conformance with the idea that "[everything was presumed to have been created perfectly by God](https://www.bookbrowse.com/reviews/index.cfm/book_number/2721/darwins-ghosts)" -- sometimes under threat of death.  
Third Party Reviews / Summaries:  
"Darwin's Ghosts by Rebecca Stott – review." By Richard Fortey, Fri 1 Jun 2012. (accessed 2023-09-19)  [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/darwins-ghosts-rebecca-stott-review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/01/darwins-ghosts-rebecca-stott-review)  
https://catalog.urbandalelibrary.org/polaris/search/title.aspx?ctx=3.1033.0.0.3&pos=4&cn=146154  
>A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK "[An] extraordinarily wide-ranging and engaging book [about] the men who shaped the work of Charles Darwin . . . a book that enriches our understanding of how the struggle to think new thoughts is shared across time and space and people."-- The Sunday Telegraph (London) Soon after the publication of On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin received an unsettling letter that accused him of taking credit for a theory that had already been discovered by others. Realizing his error of omission, Darwin tried to trace all of the natural philosophers who had laid the groundwork for his theory, but he found that history had already forgotten many of them. Rebecca Stott goes in search of these ghosts, telling the epic story of the discovery of evolution and natural selection from Aristotle to the ninth-century Arab writer Al-Jahiz to Leonardo da Vinci to the brilliant naturalists of the Jardin des Plantes to Alfred Wallace and Erasmus Darwin, and finally to Charles Darwin himself. Evolution was not discovered single-handedly. It was an idea that was advanced over centuries by daring individuals across the globe who had the imagination to speculate on nature's extraordinary ways--and the courage to articulate such speculations at a time when to do so was often considered heresy. Praise for Darwin's Ghosts "Absorbing . . . Stott captures the breathless excitement of an investigation on the cusp of the unknown. . . . A lively, original book."-- The New York Times Book Review "Stott's research is broad and unerring; her book is wonderful. . . . An exhilarating romp through 2,000 years of fascinating scientific history."-- Nature "Stott brings Darwin himself to life. . . . [She] writes with a novelist's flair. . . . Darwin and the 'ghosts' so richly described in Ms. Stott's enjoyable book are the descendants of Aristotle and Bacon and the ancestors of today's scientists."-- The Wall Street Journal "Riveting . . . Stott has done a wonderful job in showing just how many extraordinary people had speculated on where we came from before the great theorist dispelled all doubts."-- The Guardian (U.K.)

Quote:  
>A meager stain in the corridors of history, that's all we are. A little mark of scuff.  

This is an excellent story about a collection of kind people starting with a chance meeting in 1940s wartime Italy, then a neighborhood bar in London after the war, and a neighborhood in Florence in the 1950s, 60s, and into the 70s.  *see the either or both of the reviews below...*

<summary>The Wright Brothers. By David McCullough. 2015</summary>

### The Wright Brothers.  
By [David McCullough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCullough) (July 7, 1933 – August 7, 2022)  
Publisher: Simon & Schuster Audio, 2015.  
[https://catalog.urbandalelibrary.org/...](https://catalog.urbandalelibrary.org/polaris/search/title.aspx?ctx=3.1033.0.0.3&pos=1&cn=178265)  
Readers Notes:  Author David McCullough describes the unique, courageous brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright, who did the science, engineering, and construction leading to the first powered, heavier-than-air machine to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard on December 17, 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  McCullough carries the story through the brother's *perfection* of their machine and its marketing to a sometimes flight-crazed world, their efforts to protect their patents -- all the while providing context by weaving in the brother's family life.

<summary>Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth & Power. By Noam Chomsky.  2017</summary>

### Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth & Power.  
By [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky)  (1928 - __)  
[Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_the_American_Dream):  
>(*This is*) a book by political activist and linguist Noam Chomsky. It was created and edited by Peter Hutchinson, Kelly Nyks, and Jared P. Scott. It lays out Chomsky's analysis of [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism).  It focuses on the concentration of wealth and power in United States over the past forty years, analyzing the [income inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality).  The book was published by Seven Stories Press in 2017.  
>The book charts Chomsky's analysis of the concentration of wealth from the 1970s to now. Chomsky analyzes the way in which power relations shifted from the late 1940s to today, in the name of "plutocratic interests".[2] This shift in power relations ends up being an assault "on lower- and middle-class people, which has escalated in recent decades during the ascendancy of what is known as 'neoliberalism' – with fiscal austerity for the poor and tax cuts and other subsidies for the wealthy minority."[3] Chomsky is most interested in how the rise of financialization, which "is a process whereby financial markets, financial institutions, and financial elites gain greater influence over economic policy and economic outcomes,"[4] and how it affects and shapes public life in America, leading to a concentration of wealth and power to elite persons and institutions. This has been shown to lead to phenomena like the richest people in the world having as much wealth as the bottom half of the world.

Reading Notes:  

[Publisher's Summary](https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/allworth-press/9781621534877/how-music-dies-or-lives/):  
All recordings document life, arising from a specific time and place, and if that place is artificial, the results will be as well.  Culled from a lifetime of learning through failure and designed to provoke thought and inspiration for artists in every medium, How Music Dies (or Lives) is a virtual how-to manual for those on a quest for authenticity in an age of airbrushed and Auto-Tuned so-called "artists."  Author and Grammy-winning producer Ian Brennan chronicles his own journeys to find new and ancient sounds, textured voices, and nonmalleable songs, and he presents readers with an intricate look at our technological society.  His concise prose covers topics such as:  

* The damages of colonization in generalizing distinctive variations  
* The need for imperfection  
* The gaps between manufacturing and invention  
* The saturation of music in everyday life  

This guide serves those who ask themselves, "What's wrong with our culture?" Along with possible answers are lessons in using the microphone as a telescope, hearing the earth as an echo, and appreciating the value of democratizing voices.

>By 1800... plant fuels still supply more than 98 percent of all heat and light used by [humans (*as opposed to coal or animal oils*)], and human and animal muscles still provide more than 90% of all mechanical energy needed in farming, construction, and manufacturing. ...Even by 1850, rising coal extraction in Europe and North America supplies no more than 7% of all fuel energy, nearly half of all useful kenetic energy comes from draft animals, about 40% from human muscles, and just 15% from the three inanimate prime movers: waterwheels, windmills, and the slowly spreading steam engines. ...by 1900...modern energy sources (coal and some crude oil) provide half of all primary energy, and traditional fuels (wood, charcoal, straw) the other half.  ...By 1900, inanimate prime movers supply about half of all mechanical energy... By 1950, fossil fuels supply nearly 3/4 of primary energy (still dominated by coal) and inanimate prime movers...provide more than 80% of all mechanical energy... (page 17)  
>...by the year 2000...only (about 12%) depend on biomass fuels for primary energy. ... Animate prime movers hold only a 5% share of mechanical energy... 1,500-fold increase (*in the use of fossil fuels*) over the past 220 years. (page 18)  
>since 1800 the gain (*in overall energy efficiency*) was about 3,500-fold. ... An average inhabitant of the Earth nowadays has at their disposal nearly 700 times more useful energy than their ancestors had at the beginning of the 19th century. ...(*by 2020*)it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be...between 200 and 240. (page 19)  
>..."the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services." ...Given all these readily verifiable realities, it is hard to understand why modern economics has largely ignored energy. ...as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone... Understanding how the world really works cannot be done without at least a modicum of energy literacy. (page 21)  
>...our civilization is so deeply reliant on fossil fuels that the next transition will take much longer than most people think. (page 22)  
>Energy is among the most elusive and most misunderstood concepts, and a poor grasp of basic realities has led to many illusions and delusions. (page 23)  (*It is often not practical/possible to substitute one form of energy with another*)  
Energy: The common definition == "The capacity for doing work" or (*Richard Feynman*) "energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one.  These are gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy."  
>...Electricity still supplies only a relatively small share of the final global energy consumption, just 18 percent. (page 35)
