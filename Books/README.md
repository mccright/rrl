Summary:  
..."nanotechnology made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what *should* be done with it had become far more important than imagining what *could* be done with it." (page 37)  This book [covers a lot of territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age).
