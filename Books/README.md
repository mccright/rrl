<summary>Reading Notes: </summary>

This story has enormous scope, incorporating a broad spectrum of [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_themes) and [religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_ideas_in_science_fiction) themes as it builds out science, technology, religion, and secular societies across multiple worlds.  
Some Quotes:  
>Its general import is that one should never believe a thing only because one wishes that it were true.  
>They knew many things but had no idea why.  And strangely this made them more, rather than less, certain that they were right.  
>"That is the kind of beauty that I was trying to get you to see," Orolo told me. "Nothing is more important than that you see and love the beauty that is right in front of you, or else you will have no defense against the ugliness that will hem you in and come at you in so many ways."  
>Thousands of years ago, the work that people did had been broken down into jobs that were the same every day, in organizations where people were interchangeable parts.  All of the story had been bled out of their lives.  That was how it had to be; it was how you got a productive economy.  But it would be easy to see a will at work behind this: not exactly an evil will, but a selfish will.  The people who made this system thus were jealous, not of money and not of power but of story.  If their employees came home at day's end with interesting stories to tell, it meant something had gone wrong...  
>There is no longer superposition.  No wavefunction collapse.  Just a lot of copies of me -- of my brain -- each really existing in a different parallel cosmos.  The cosmos model residing in each of those parallel brains is really, definitely in one state or another.  And they interfere with one another.  
>Quantum interference -- the crosstalk among similar quantum states -- knits the different versions of your brain together.  
>Hearing was worse than useless; I was sorry I'd been born with ears.  
>And it happened all the time that the compromise between two perfectly rational altrnatives was something that made no sense at all.  
>There is one universe, by the definition of *universe*. It is not the cosmos we see through our eyes and our telescopes -- *that* is but a single Narrative, a thread winding through a Hemm space shared by many other Narratives besides ours.  Each Narrative looks like a cosmos alone, to any consciousness that partakes of it.  
>...the only way to determine the direction of time's arrow was to measure the amount of disorder in a system. The cosmos seems oblivious to time.  It only matters to us.  Consciousness is time-constituting.  We build time up out of instantaneous impressions that flow in through our sensory organs at each moment.  
>We don't give our consciousness sufficient credit for its ability to take in noisy, ambiguous, contradictory givens from the senses, and sort it out... to confer *thisness* on what we perceive.  ...absolutely necessary from an evolutionary standpoint...  
>The full cosmos consists of the physical stuff and consciousness.  Take away the consciouness and it's only dust; add consciousness and you get things, ideas, and time.  
>"All right, already!  I get it! The Hylaean Flow brings about convergent development of consciousness-bearing systems across worldtracks!  But where is the payoff?  There's got to be more to it than this big ship roaming from cosmos to cosmos collecting sample populations and embalming them in spheres."  
>I thought that I was like a man lame in one leg, who learned to move about well enough that all awareness of his disability had passed out of his mind.  And yet, when he tried to go on a journey, he kept finding himself back where he had started, since his weak leg made him go in circles.  But if he found a partner who was weak in the other leg, and the two of them set out as companions...  
>Then I happened to glance down at the coffin beside my knee, and wondered... Who had given the order...  
>There are certain worldtracks -- certain states of affairs -- that are only compatible with certain persons' being...absent.  
>Upsight: A sudden, usually unlooked-for moment of clear understanding.  
>The mystic nails a symbol to one meaning that was true for a moment but soon becomes false.  The poet, on the other hand, sees that truth *while it's true* but understands that symbols are always in flux and that their meanings are fleeting.... Anyway, my point is that guys like Flec have a weakness, almost a kind of addiction, for the mystical, as opposed to poetic, way of using their minds.  
>...the evolution of our minds from bits of inanimate matter was more beautiful and more extraordinary than any of the miracles cataloged down through the ages by the religions of our world. And so he had an instinctive skepticism of any system of thought, religious or theorical, that pretended to encompass that miracle, and in so doing sought to draw limits around it.  
>I was an adjunct professor, which means that I was given the most unpleasant and unrewarding teaching assignments with no opportunity for university-supported research, no job security, and no benefits.  Also the pay was terrible...  
>Well, that would challenge certain assumptions about the nature of reality that I did not even know I had.

<summary>The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.  By Neal Stephenson  1995</summary>

### The Diamond Age or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age  
By [Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson)  
Published 1995  
Summary:  
..."nanotechnology made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what *should* be done with it had become far more important than imagining what *could* be done with it." (page 37)  This book [covers a lot of territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age).  Written in the early 1990s, Stephenson created a world in the 3rd or 4th decade of the 21st century where nanotechnology had changed *everything* and humanity was characterized by extreme tribalism.

<summary>Reading Notes:</summary>

>By 1800... plant fuels still supply more than 98 percent of all heat and light used by [humans (*as opposed to coal or animal oils*)], and human and animal muscles still provide more than 90% of all mechanical energy needed in farming, construction, and manufacturing. ...Even by 1850, rising coal extraction in Europe and North America supplies no more than 7% of all fuel energy, nearly half of all useful kenetic energy comes from draft animals, about 40% from human muscles, and just 15% from the three inanimate prime movers: waterwheels, windmills, and the slowly spreading steam engines. ...by 1900...modern energy sources (coal and some crude oil) provide half of all primary energy, and traditional fuels (wood, charcoal, straw) the other half.  ...By 1900, inanimate prime movers supply about half of all mechanical energy... By 1950, fossil fuels supply nearly 3/4 of primary energy (still dominated by coal) and inanimate prime movers...provide more than 80% of all mechanical energy... (page 17)  
>...by the year 2000...only (about 12%) depend on biomass fuels for primary energy. ... Animate prime movers hold only a 5% share of mechanical energy... 1,500-fold increase (*in the use of fossil fuels*) over the past 220 years. (page 18)  
>since 1800 the gain (*in overall energy efficiency*) was about 3,500-fold. ... An average inhabitant of the Earth nowadays has at their disposal nearly 700 times more useful energy than their ancestors had at the beginning of the 19th century. ...(*by 2020*)it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be...between 200 and 240. (page 19)  
>..."the economic system is essentially a system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into energy embodied in products and services." ...Given all these readily verifiable realities, it is hard to understand why modern economics has largely ignored energy. ...as if output could be produced by labor and capital alone... Understanding how the world really works cannot be done without at least a modicum of energy literacy. (page 21)  
>...our civilization is so deeply reliant on fossil fuels that the next transition will take much longer than most people think. (page 22)  
>Energy is among the most elusive and most misunderstood concepts, and a poor grasp of basic realities has led to many illusions and delusions. (page 23)  (*It is often not practical/possible to substitute one form of energy with another*)  
Energy: The common definition == "The capacity for doing work" or (*Richard Feynman*) "energy has a large number of different forms, and there is a formula for each one.  These are gravitational energy, kinetic energy, heat energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, nuclear energy, mass energy."  
>...Electricity still supplies only a relatively small share of the final global energy consumption, just 18 percent. (page 35)  
>...(*the amount of electricity generated by*) nuclear fission...peaked in 2006, and has since declined slightly to about 10 percent of global electricity generation. (page 36)  
>Given the fact that annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion surpassed 37 billion tons in 2019, the net-zero goal by 2050 will call for an energy transition of unprecented in both pace and scale. (page 38)  
>Annual global demand for fossil carbon is now (2019) just above 10 million tons a year -- a mass nearly five times more than the recent annual harvest of all stable grains feeding humanity, and more than twice the mass of water drunk annual by the world's nearly 8 billion (2019) inhabitants...  (page 42)  

Mechanical energy: Isaac Newton's approach == a joule is the force of one newton, or '*the mass of 1 kilogram accelerated by 1 m/s² acting over a distance of 1 meter*.

[Harvard Book Store](https://www.harvard.com/book/how_the_world_really_works/) review:  
>"An essential analysis of the modern science and technology that makes our twenty-first century lives possible--a scientist's investigation into what science really does, and does not, accomplish. We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don’t know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity."
