By Neal Stephenson  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson  
Published 1995  
Summary:  
..."nanotechnology made nearly anything possible, and so the cultural role in deciding what *should* be done with it had become far more important than imagining what *could* be done with it." (page 37)  This book [covers a lot of territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age).  Stephenson created a world in the 3rd or 4th decade of the 21st century where nanotechnology had changed *everything* and humanity was characterized by extreme tribalism.
